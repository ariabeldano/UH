participant,paragraph,speaker,text
participant9,1,Interviewer ,"Yeah, oh and thank you for agreeing to meet with me.  So the first thing is have you spoken to any of the other guys who've done the interview with me already? "
participant9,2,Interviewee,I don't know of anyone else have done the interview. 
participant9,3,Interviewer ,"Fine, okay.  So there are a couple of other people that have done interviews with me so I just wanted to know if you'd had a chance or whether you've chatted to any of them about it or… not particularly?"
participant9,4,Interviewee ,Hmm.  
participant9,5,Interviewer ,"Okay, all right.  Well that's no problem it was just to see if there was anything you'd kind of been discussing already for us to talk about.  So I think I will tend to start with asking is what word do you tend to use for testicles?"
participant9,6,Interviewee ,I don't know. 
participant9,7,Mother ,What do you call them?  Not to feel embarrassed cos that's what you came to talk about and please what do you call them with your chat to your pals? 
participant9,8,Interviewee ,Just don't talk about that stuff.  
participant9,9,Mother ,If you were going to talk to [name].
participant9,10,Interviewee ,"Yeah, "
participant9,11,Mother ,Say you've been playing football and you kicked the ball and it hit him in his testicles.
participant9,12,Interviewee ,In the balls. 
participant9,13,Interviewer ,"Yeah, that's a pretty good word.  I think that's a pretty common word actually.  I think a lot of people use balls.  Fine, but like you were saying that probably isn't something that you talk about normally."
participant9,14,Interviewee ,Hmm.
participant9,15,Interviewer ,I can understand that as well.  Have you ever had… like need to…have you ever talked about testicles or balls?
participant9,16,Interviewee ,Not really no
participant9,17,Interviewer ,"Not really, so with your mates?  And what about your Mother?"
participant9,18,Interviewee ,A bit.   
participant9,19,Interviewer ,Fine.
participant9,20,Interviewee ,Hmm?
participant9,21,Interviewer ,Fine.
participant9,22,Interviewee ,Oh.
participant9,23,Interviewer ,And what kind of things have you talked to your Mother about?
participant9,24,Interviewee ,Certain… just generally size of them cos there's different sizes.
participant9,25,Interviewer ,"Okay, all right.  So you've noticed in yourself that the testicles are different sizes?"
participant9,26,Interviewee ,Yeah. 
participant9,27,Interviewer ,Fine and when was… like when was this that you noticed this?
participant9,28,Interviewee ,A month or two ago.
participant9,29,Interviewer ,"Okay, fine.  Fine, fine, so then how did you… how long had you been worrying about it or how long had you noticed it for?"
participant9,30,Interviewee ,I wasn't really worried about it just didn't know if it was normal.
participant9,31,Interviewer ,"Yeah, yeah fine.  I guess I was kind of asking about how long did it take you to talk to your Mother about it?  Was it like kind of thing where as soon as you noticed it, you thought, oh right gonna talk to my Mother or did you kind of wait a while or wha"
participant9,32,Interviewer ,"Three or four weeks, okay.  So fine and how did you first… have you… has someone talked to you about any… have you… did you see a doctor?  What did you do?  Have you…"
participant9,33,Interviewee ,Dad said that it's just normal.
participant9,34,Interviewer ,"Yeah okay, yeah, yeah.  Fine, fine, so you kind of had a bit of a conversation about it and at the moment you realised that was something not to… not to worry about…"
participant9,35,Interviewee ,Yeah.
participant9,36,Interviewer ,"particularly, fine.  So is there anything else that… do you know about any other things like problems that you might get with your testicles?"
participant9,37,Interviewee ,"Not really, no."
participant9,38,Interviewer ,Okay and have you had like any lessons yet about testicles and balls and things and what they do?
participant9,39,Interviewee ,In science.  
participant9,40,Interviewer ,"In science was it, so in your biology lessons?"
participant9,41,Interviewee ,Yeah.
participant9,42,Interviewer ,Yeah fine and what kind of things did you talk about there?
participant9,43,Interviewee ,Reproduction.
participant9,44,Interviewer ,"Aha, okay.  So is that about like sex and things like that?"
participant9,45,Interviewee ,Yeah.
participant9,46,Interviewer ,"And what did you talk about with the testicles specifically, was there anything about them?  "
participant9,47,Interviewee ,Talked about what like what the… what their purpose was.
participant9,48,Interviewer ,"Fine, so… and do you feel like… you feel happy and clear about that.  Do you think you'd be able to tell us this, I know obviously it's slightly unusual talking, but what are the functions of the testicles?  Do you know?"
participant9,49,Interviewee ,Make sperm.
participant9,50,Interviewer ,"Yeah, that's absolutely right and do you know about their other functions?  The other important things they do?"
participant9,51,Interviewee ,No.
participant9,52,Interviewer ,So they talked about them a bit with sex but maybe not so much about the other things they do?
participant9,53,Interviewee ,"No, not really just reproduction we did. "
participant9,54,Interviewer ,"Fine, so if I say to you that they make hormones as well.  Do you know about the hormones that they make?"
participant9,55,Interviewee ,"Hmm, they went over a bit… like a little bit, but not that much."
participant9,56,Interviewer ,Do you think they did mention it to you or do you think it's… you know or do you think that maybe… do you think they did mention that bit or not really?   
participant9,57,Interviewee ,Briefly.
participant9,58,Interviewer ,"Briefly, fine, fine, so now that you say it, you go oh yeah, yeah, fine.  You can recall that bit about it cos it makes many important hormones that obviously helps you go through puberty. "
participant9,59,Interviewee ,Hmm.
participant9,60,Interviewer ,And stuff like that.  So you've had lessons about that in your biology lessons?
participant9,61,Interviewee ,Yeah.
participant9,62,Interviewer ,Have you had any other lessons about?
participant9,63,Interviewee ,"Not really, no. "
participant9,64,Interviewer ,"No, okay and in terms of kind of your… due you have share or are you on… is it you know what's your… do you like social classes at the moment?"
participant9,65,Interviewee ,No.
participant9,66,Interviewer ,So are you at the moment are you in high school?
participant9,67,Interviewee ,Yeah.
participant9,68,Interviewer ,"Yeah, so you're first year high school?"
participant9,69,Interviewee ,Yeah.
participant9,70,Interviewer ,"Yeah, okay fine and have you had any lessons about any aspects of… it's called like there's about a hundred different names for it…"
participant9,71,Interviewee ,Hmm. 
participant9,72,Interviewer ,"It's like PSHCE, PSE, PSHARE like all these different classes."
participant9,73,Interviewee ,We have PSE in English.
participant9,74,Interviewer ,"Yeah, fine, fine, fine and have you talked about any of it, like kind of the testicles have you gone into anything like that with them? "
participant9,75,Interviewee ,No.
participant9,76,Interviewer ,Okay.
participant9,77,Interviewee ,Because the teachers been ill so we haven't really done it recently
participant9,78,Interviewer ,"Oh, and which teacher teaches you it?  Is it your form tutor or your…?"
participant9,79,Interviewee ,It's just like a stand-in teacher.
participant9,80,Interviewer ,A stand-in teacher at the moment… 
participant9,81,Interviewee ,Yeah.
participant9,82,Interviewer ,for your PSE lessons and stuff and are you made aware of the kind of curriculum… whatever lessons that are going to be happening or not particularly? 
participant9,83,Mother ,"Not really, not…"
participant9,84,Interviewer ,"So [laughter] it turns up and you're like, all right."
participant9,85,Mother ,What about in P7 did you talk anything like that in P7?
participant9,86,Interviewee ,Yeah.
participant9,87,Mother ,Yeah.  What was that called again?
participant9,88,Interviewee ,"Called ""seven plan""."
participant9,89,Interviewer ,Oh and what did you talk about?  Did you talk about again with that kind of…
participant9,90,Interviewee ,Yeah.
participant9,91,Interviewer ,Was that growing up and what's going to happen with puberty kind of chats?
participant9,92,Interviewee  ,Yeah.
participant9,93,Interviewer ,"Yeah, yeah, but maybe, okay all right, all right.  So do you know what would you do if you suddenly got quite a lot of pain in your testicle or ball?"
participant9,94,Interviewee ,Tell my Mother or dad.
participant9,95,Interviewer ,Fine and like when would you tell them and how would you tell them do you think?
participant9,96,Interviewee ,Wait maybe about one or two days and then just go up to them and say I've got a bit of pain in my balls.
participant9,97,Interviewer ,"Okay, all right and why do you think you'd wait a little while?"
participant9,98,Interviewee ,"Just because it might stop, someone hit a football and it hit my…   "
participant9,99,Interviewer ,"Yeah, so you've previous pain?"
participant9,100,Interviewee ,Yeah.
participant9,101,Interviewer ,But ended up kind of going away on its own?
participant9,102,Interviewee ,"Yes, hmm. "
participant9,103,Mother ,Yes.
participant9,104,Interviewer ,"Yes, okay and so you've occasionally had a bit of pain down below and in your balls maybe that kind of got better.  And what do you think it would be that would make you talk to your parents about it?"
participant9,105,Interviewee ,I don't know.
participant9,106,Interviewer ,And do you think you talk to your parents before your friends?
participant9,107,Interviewee ,Probably.
participant9,108,Interviewer ,Do you think you'd ever tell your friends you had a pain in your balls or something?
participant9,109,Interviewee ,No.
participant9,110,Interviewer ,And why do you think not?
participant9,111,Interviewee ,Just because we don't talk about that kind of stuff normally.
participant9,112,Interviewer ,"When you mean that kind of stuff, what do you mean?  What do you mean by that?"
participant9,113,Interviewee ,Like private stuff.
participant9,114,Interviewer ,"Yeah and why do you think that testicles are private?  I think you're absolutely right.  I'm totally agreeing with you, but I'm just kind of interested to find out what it is about them that maybe makes them private and something that you wouldn't necessa"
participant9,115,Interviewee ,"Just cos you sort of wouldn't like show them in public, so…"
participant9,116,Interviewer ,Yeah.
participant9,117,Interviewee ,and it's private.
participant9,118,Interviewer ,"Yeah, yeah okay, cos you'd [laughter] probably get arrested if you started to show them in public wouldn't you?  Yeah, you're absolutely right, so there's maybe a part of it that they're covered away and you don't see them very much.  And do you think the"
participant9,119,Interviewee ,It's not a real problem.
participant9,120,Interviewer ,It's not really a problem.  If one of your mates came to you and said they had pain in their testicles…
participant9,121,Interviewee ,I'd tell them to go and see a doctor.
participant9,122,Interviewer ,"Yeah, that seems like a very sensible thing to say.  And do you think you'd feel shy or embarrassed if your friend came to you? "
participant9,123,Interviewee ,A bit embarrassed. 
participant9,124,Interviewer ,Yeah.
participant9,125,Interviewee ,Because you don't expect them to come to me first. 
participant9,126,Interviewer ,Yeah.
participant9,127,Interviewee ,You'd expect them to go to their Mother or dad.
participant9,128,Interviewer ,Yeah.  So if you do have problems with your health I guess generally the first person you tell is your Mother or your dad.
participant9,129,Interviewee ,Hmm [affirmative]. 
participant9,130,Interviewer ,Yeah.  And if it's your testicles is it different?  Do you think you'd be more likely to go to your dad or more likely to go to your Mother?
participant9,131,Interviewee ,Probably my dad.
participant9,132,Interviewer ,"Yeah, yeah fine.  And I'm going to ask your Mother now.  What do think you'd do in the case of like testicular pain, so pain in the balls.  I don't know have you ever… have you got any experience anything like this, you know, know anyone whose had anythin"
participant9,133,Mother ,"No, but my background is a nurse.  I'm a nurse with a background in pain so that probably makes me guilty of like leaving things…"
participant9,134,Interviewer ,[Laughter] no I think lots of people do.
participant9,135,Interviewee ,Yeah.
participant9,136,Interviewer ,"Medics and nurses, generally the worse for it, definitely."
participant9,137,Mother ,"Yeah, if it was anything that was ongoing I think I probably go and get it seen."
participant9,138,Interviewer ,"Yeah, yeah and where would be your port of call do you think with testicular pain?"
participant9,139,Interviewee ,"Doc, GP."
participant9,140,Interviewer ,"Your GP? Your family doctor, yeah.  And have you been to your GP.  Have you seen them for anything in particular?"
participant9,141,Interviewee ,"Not really, no.  No, I don't think so."
participant9,142,Interviewer ,"Yeah, you know what young people are like, (inaudible 10:16)  family doctor.  Have you ever been to the hospital?"
participant9,143,Interviewee ,"Once, it was because I broke… I'd done something to my collarbone. "
participant9,144,Interviewer ,Did you break it?
participant9,145,Interviewee ,I actually don't really know what happened
participant9,146,Mother ,We don't really know.
participant9,147,Interviewer ,But it seems it got better?
participant9,148,Interviewee ,"Yeah, it's fine now."
participant9,149,Interviewer ,"Good, good and you got seen was it… were you in the emergency department was it?"
participant9,150,Interviewee ,I don't know.
participant9,151,Mother,"Yeah, I remember, you were in P2. "
participant9,152,Interviewee ,P3 
participant9,153,Mother ,It was P2 it was Mrs R [teachers name].  We went up to Yorkhill to A&E.
participant9,154,Interviewer ,Fine and did you end up having to go into the hospital or did you just get treated in the emergency department?   
participant9,155,Interviewee ,Yeah. 
participant9,156,Interviewer ,"Yeah, so have you been on a ward before?"
participant9,157,Interviewee ,"No, never. "
participant9,158,Interviewer ,What do you think about things like hospitals and have you got any impressions of them like…? 
participant9,159,Interviewer ,"Yeah, sure.  And you've not had an operation then I'm guessing."
participant9,160,Interviewee ,No.
participant9,161,Interviewer ,Do you know anyone who's had an operation?
participant9,162,Interviewee ,"Hmm, my granny has.  "
participant9,163,Interviewer ,"Right, right and she's been in hospital then I guess?  And have you visited her there?"
participant9,164,Interviewee ,"No, cos she… I don't know why."
participant9,165,Mother ,(inaudible 11:33)
participant9,166,Interviewee ,Visit (inaudible 11:34).
participant9,167,Mother ,"She was only in for a couple of days each time wasn't she, so…"
participant9,168,Interviewer ,"Fine, so she didn't have to spend too long."
participant9,169,Mother ,Yeah.  
participant9,170,Interviewer ,"Yeah, I mean yeah, yeah don't want to maybe disrupt you like, yeah. "
participant9,171,Mother ,"Yeah, probably get better."
participant9,172,Interviewer ,Yeah.
participant9,173,Mother ,(Inaudible 11:48) 
participant9,174,Interviewer ,"[Laughter] oh that's it.  I'm sure she'd love to have you around,"
participant9,175,Interviewee ,"Hmm, no. "
participant9,176,Interviewer ,Have you heard of anything from your friends or your family or any famous people?
participant9,177,Interviewee ,No.
participant9,178,Interviewer ,"Okay, so the reason that I'm… a big part of the reason why I'm doing this project is because there's a thing called testicular torsion or testicular twisting and I don't know have you ever heard of this? "
participant9,179,Interviewee ,No. 
participant9,180,Interviewer ,Now that I'm saying it.  And have you ever heard of it?
participant9,181,Mother ,Yeah. 
participant9,182,Interviewer ,"Yeah, so it's a problem you can get which some boys get which is if the testicle twists it ends up… because you know your testicle is on a string effectively that's got the blood supply in it.  If your testicle twists then it cuts off its own blood supply"
participant9,183,Mother ,Yeah.
participant9,184,Interviewee ,Does it… when it just like literally twists?
participant9,185,Interviewer ,"Yes, literally twist, yeah exactly right, exactly right. "
participant9,186,Interviewee ,Oh.
participant9,187,Interviewer ,And it's the kind of thing whereby you don't need pa… like really worry this doesn't happen to everyone but it happens to enough people so about 1:800 people before they're 25; so it's up to… so it's young persons; so it's people of your age group.  So th
participant9,188,Interviewee ,Hmm.
participant9,189,Interviewer ,why do you think a lot of people don't come?
participant9,190,Interviewee ,Because they're thinking it will maybe get better.
participant9,191,Interviewer ,"Yeah, exactly what I think."
participant9,192,Interviewee ,I think that's what I thought.
participant9,193,Interviewer ,"Yeah and I think that's really true and that's really common, yeah exactly.  Do you think people… do you know the word optimistic?"
participant9,194,Interviewee ,"Hmm, no. "
participant9,195,Interviewer ,You know when people kind of always want to sort of think about the good things and…
participant9,196,Interviewee ,Yes.
participant9,197,Interviewer ,"Do you think… I always wonder if people are a bit optimistic about their health as well hoping that, you know hoping that it’s the best and then for kind of like not exactly necessarily totally appreciating it might be something serious.  The fact that yo"
participant9,198,Interviewee ,"A bit, yeah. "
participant9,199,Interviewer ,A bit.  Do you think you would be a bit worried an operation?
participant9,200,Interviewee ,Yeah.
participant9,201,Interviewer ,"So the operation is something that's quite safe and you know that we do these operations, so we'd obviously look after you.  Do you think it would be funny to have a general anaesthetic to go to sleep for it? "
participant9,202,Interviewee ,No.
participant9,203,Interviewer ,"You'd be all right with that bit of it… fine, fine.  And what about… so when you come to hospital would it bother you if you saw a lady doctor or a man doctor?  Would that bother you either way?"
participant9,204,Interviewee ,"Not really, because they're trained to do the same thing."
participant9,205,Interviewer ,"Yeah, I think really think that's a very sensible answer, that's great.  So do you know about anything else that can happen to testicles?  So twisting is one and you can sometimes get fluid around your testicles but the other big thing people talk about i"
participant9,206,Interviewee ,Hmm.  
participant9,207,Interviewer ,Have you ever heard about lumps and what you might be worried about with lumps in the testicles?
participant9,208,Interviewee ,No.
participant9,209,Interviewer ,Has anyone told you about self-examination.
participant9,210,Interviewee ,No.
participant9,211,Interviewer ,"Okay, so… and again I apologise if this is anything that's personal or difficult but you can get cancer in the testicles as well, so again, it's very unusual, it's very unlikely but we recommend that all young people probably examine their testicles about"
participant9,212,Interviewee ,No.
participant9,213,Interviewer ,"No, so testicular cancer is generally very curable if it's caught early, so that's why we talk about it, it's rarer, it's about four times less likely than a twisted testicle, and again it's a bit older so it's about 25, so if you were that little bit old"
participant9,214,Interviewee ,So is it just like a big lump?
participant9,215,Interviewer ,"You'd feel… you'd feel a lump in your testicle, yeah."
participant9,216,Interviewee ,So you'd be able to help?
participant9,217,Interviewer ,"Yeah, so what would be a good way of describing it, so if you imagine something like… cause it feels a bit like a siliconey blob doesn't it your testicle and imagine like there's a bit of a stone in it or something hard that feels like a different consist"
participant9,218,Interviewee ,Hmm.
participant9,219,Interviewer ,"If… right, so I've obviously talked to you now a bit about that.  If you had found a lump in your testicle before this chat can you imagine… what would you have done about it?     "
participant9,220,Interviewee ,Hmm told my dad or someone. 
participant9,221,Interviewer ,"Yep, again really sensible.  Do you think you'd ever of had a look for yourself for information from anywhere?"
participant9,222,Interviewee ,No.
participant9,223,Interviewer ,So do you use the Internet do you ever to look for things.  Do you think this is something you would use the Internet for or not so much?
participant9,224,Interviewee ,No. 
participant9,225,Interviewer ,"no and I'm going to ask you another similar kind of question, if… I mean I guess again you've got a background of nursing; again the stuff I'm saying about testicular cancer is that stuff that you knew a bit about or…?  "
participant9,226,Mother ,"Yeah probably, yeah."
participant9,227,Interviewer ,So… and again if someone came to you with a lump you probably would first port of call see your GP rather than sort of look up stuff yourself.
participant9,228,Mother ,I would probably look stuff up and worry. 
participant9,229,Interviewer ,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, no yeah that's great, that's great."
participant9,230,Mother ,I'd use the Internet and look at NHS Web sites and stuff.
participant9,231,Interviewer ,"Right, so you probably would look for that kind of badge as a sign of quality information."
participant9,232,Mother ,Yeah.
participant9,233,Interviewer ,Would you think that there was… that there might be… that the information might be… some of it might not be… might be a bit biased if it's not necessarily got an NHS badge on it or…
participant9,234,Mother ,The NHS NICE something like that…
participant9,235,Interviewer ,"Yeah, so you know.   "
participant9,236,Interviewer ,"Because there might be some other stuff that you can't quite trust as much, fine."
participant9,237,Interviewer ,"So where do you find it?  Where do you get information about stuff from mostly?  I'm asking you really tough questions aren't I [laughter].  You're like, what is she asking me?  So have you ever heard of any famous people that have had problems with their"
participant9,238,Interviewee ,No.
participant9,239,Interviewer ,"No, fine and obviously, none of your friends or family have had any problems.  So you're going to be the expert now I think [laughter] good, good.  So I've told you are few things today and I get the impression that a lot of it is just stuff that's never "
participant9,240,Interviewee ,Hmm.  
participant9,241,Interviewer ,If I was trying to teach you know like a huge number of boys and young people and young men stuff about it what do you think would be effective ways of telling people about testicular health problems?
participant9,242,Interviewee ,Through emails because you could spend so time… 
participant9,243,Interviewer ,Yeah.
participant9,244,Interviewee ,with gadgets.
participant9,245,Interviewer ,"Yeah, yeah.  What accounts do you have at the moment?  Do you… in terms of your…?"
participant9,246,Interviewee ,Email.
participant9,247,Interviewer ,You have an email.  Do you have…
participant9,248,Interviewee ,Social media.  
participant9,249,Interviewer ,Which ones do you have from social media?
participant9,250,Interviewee ,Snapchat and Instagram.
participant9,251,Interviewer ,"Snapchat and Instagram fine, fine and sending out an email."
participant9,252,Mother ,Yeah.
participant9,253,Interviewer ,I'm just trying to think you know how to make these things work. 
participant9,254,Interviewee ,Maybe if like they… like send stuff out from like social media…
participant9,255,Interviewer ,Hmm.
participant9,256,Interviewee ,and add like to people or something.
participant9,257,Interviewer ,"Hmm, yeah I know absolutely I can see that.  Do you think that if you get taught about these things in schools you'll take them seriously?  Do you think the school is a good… place for it or do you think it's better not at school?"
participant9,258,Interviewee ,You know I don't really mind.
participant9,259,Interviewer ,"I know you don't seem like [laughter] very being pragmatic, yeah okay, fine.  So there is nothing that you would… springs to mind straight away is oh that would be a really good way of telling young people about this problem. "
participant9,260,Interviewee ,No. 
participant9,261,Interviewer ,"No okay, all right.  Can I say… do you talk to friends about any health problems?"
participant9,262,Interviewee ,"If I've hurt my knee I'll say, oh I'll complain to them my knee is hurting."
participant9,263,Interviewer ,"Yeah, so you're much more able to talk about your knee than your testicle aren't you?"
participant9,264,Interviewee ,Hmm.
participant9,265,Interviewer ,"Yeah, yeah and why do you think that this?"
participant9,266,Interviewee ,Say again because say it's like private.
participant9,267,Interviewer ,Hmm.
participant9,268,Interviewee ,And your knee well isn't not private. 
participant9,269,Interviewer ,"[Laughter] yeah it's not, it isn't no; not a specifically private organ, yeah absolutely right.  Yeah, okay fine.  Right, well I've got a list of questions I just wanted to ask.  I don't know if there is anything… when I was coming to talk to you today wh"
participant9,270,Interviewee ,"Yeah, just interested to see what can happen."
participant9,271,Interviewer ,"Yeah, yeah and similarly I don't think this is what you'd kind of expected you know whether there was anything else that you kind of thought about or…? "
participant9,272,Mother ,"Well, I thought it was actually going to focus on testicular cancer. "
participant9,273,Interviewer ,Yeah and the other thing that I have noticed is with the Internet and stuff is huge amounts of information about testicular cancer but very little about testicular torsion and the stuff on torsion as well I don't think is put in a way that's very… it's al
participant9,274,Mother ,No.
participant9,275,Interviewer ,"at all about… like it doesn't… to me it's not engaging, it's not very interesting it's just a dry Web site and I think it's such an important issue that it seems very odd that there's not so much that people aren't taught about it."
participant9,276,Mother ,"No, I didn't realise they were so young."
participant9,277,Interviewer ,Yes exactly.
participant9,278,Mother ,(over-talk 24:04)
participant9,279,Interviewer ,"Yes you're right and it's exactly the age group that you're coming up to now that it will be the highest risk, so… I mean, in your school I guess there will be a couple of people that have probably had a torsion and whether they've had a surgery that save"
participant9,280,Mother ,Much quicker.
participant9,281,Interviewer ,So that seems a shame.
participant9,282,Mother ,So there's just… there's pain that just presents?
participant9,283,Interviewer ,"There's pain, yeah.  You get severe pain in your testicle just come and the other thing is well to say is that it's probably best just to come to the hospital. "
participant9,284,Mother ,Straightaway? 
participant9,285,Interviewer ,"Yeah, because your GP won't be able to do the operation, so it would be to come to the… "
participant9,286,Interviewee ,Do they just give an operation straightaway?
participant9,287,Interviewer ,"Pretty much, yeah as soon as we can get theatres sorted and there's a bit of organisation on our part but yeah it's that kind of thing where we get theatres most but we generally get you to theatre within maybe an hour something like that.  So that's why "
participant9,288,Mother ,So do you have a sudden onset?
participant9,289,Interviewer ,"Yeah and it's quite severe.  I mean, it's the sort of thing where it starts quite quickly, sudden and then it's very sore."
participant9,290,Interviewee ,How sore?
participant9,291,Interviewer ,It would make you go enough.
participant9,292,Interviewer ,But I do know also having been… doing this job I have known young people to just keep quiet and not say anything at all about it because they're a bit shy or because they're hoping it will go away and that's the worst thing if you hope it goes away becaus
participant9,293,Interviewee ,So we won't do that.
participant9,294,Interviewer ,"Yeah exactly, if it ever happens we'll save you [laughter].  That's the message if there's any problem you can always talk to your Mother or dad, yeah and when you're a bit older you can see your doctor yourself as well. "
participant9,295,Mother ,"Yeah, yeah."
participant9,296,Interviewer ,"Okay, fantastic work.  Let me have a quick look, let me have a quick look, great.  Well look, I really appreciate your time thank you so much that's all really from my point of view, anything else from your point of view?"
participant9,297,Interviewee ,No.
participant9,298,Interviewer ,"Okay, all right well I will stop this then. "
participant10,1,Mother ,Alright?
participant10,2,Interviewer  ,"That sounds like a good idea. Right, so. Thank you."
participant10,3,Mother  ,(unclear 00:04) 
participant10,4,Interviewer  ,"Exactly. It's all very important, these things. So thank you so much for agreeing to do this. So I guess the first thing just to ask is have you heard the word ""testicles"" before? "
participant10,5, Interviewee ,Yup.
participant10,6,Interviewer ,"Good, great, we're starting well, starting strong. And what words would you use? How would you describe them normally? "
participant10,7, Interviewee ,Balls.
participant10,8,Interviewer ,"Balls, yeah. That seems pretty--"
participant10,9, Interviewee ,"Especially informally, yeah. That's all, really."
participant10,10,Interviewer ,"Fine. Do you think you'd ever use the word ""testicles""?"
participant10,11, Interviewee ,If it was our PSHE class where you may be talking about that kind of stuff.
participant10,12,Interviewer ,"Okay, fine. And how would it feel to use the word ""testicles"" rather than ""balls""?"
participant10,13, Interviewee ,"It would just be a bit different and weird. I wouldn't avoid using it but it just wouldn't be what I usually say. It would feel a bit different, probably."
participant10,14,Interviewer ,"So it might feel formal and it might feel like you're doing it maybe in a school setting or like a formal setting or something like that, rather than if you were talking to maybe your family or your mates? "
participant10,15, Interviewee ,Yeah.
participant10,16,Interviewer ,So do you think you'd use the same word with your Mother and dad as you would with your friends? What words do you think--do you think it would differ at all?
participant10,17, Interviewee ,"I wouldn't say so, no. Wait, do you mean testicles or balls? What word--"
participant10,18,Interviewer ,"Yeah, yeah. You said that you use ""balls"" more probably, and if you were to speak to your Mother and dad about anything, would you use the word ""balls"" do you think? Or do you speak to your Mother and dad about these kind of things? "
participant10,19, Interviewee ,Probably be balls. 
participant10,20,Interviewer ,"It'd probably be balls, yeah. I think it's a pretty good word, yeah. Pretty straightforward. Fine, and have you ever had a situation where you've had to talk to your family or your--have you ever had any concerns yourself or have you ever spoken to your f"
participant10,21, Interviewee ,"No, once or twice I've spoken to Mother. "
participant10,22,Interviewer ,"Okay, alright. So you mentioned a bit earlier about PSHCE. I know loads of different schools call them differently. So you've had lessons in the past, yeah? "
participant10,23, Interviewee ,"Not this year yet but every year. I went to Broomhill Primary School over there. I'm in Jordanhill Secondary just now, and at Broomhill, at the end, like, P6 and 7, we did a bit about that in, like, sexual health and relationships through the council curr"
participant10,24,Interviewer ,"Okay, that's interesting. "
participant10,25, Interviewee ,"But, yeah, we've done a bit about body parts and stuff like that, sexual health. "
participant10,26,Interviewer ,"Fine, so--and what kind of stuff have they talked about in those lessons, then? "
participant10,27, Interviewee ,"Just like, the proper scientific names for different parts inside your balls."
participant10,28,Interviewer ,"Fine, so kind of anatomy and the different bits within your balls so could you label, like, a diagram and stuff like that?"
participant10,29, Interviewee ,"Maybe. But, yeah, that's what we learn in school, different parts of the vagina as well and stuff like that. "
participant10,30,Interviewer ,"Fine. Did it feel quite like--did it feel helpful to you or did it feel kind of like you were learning it for learning's sake, do you know, like, did it feel like it was something helpful for you when you had those lessons? "
participant10,31, Interviewee ,"Well, yes, 'cause it's quite important, I guess. Probably more than some other things we do in school. "
participant10,32,Interviewer ,"Yeah, true. True, true. And so that was part of sex ed., was it? So they were teaching you about sex and about reproduction, about--"
participant10,33, Interviewee ,"Well, that, properly about sex is coming this year. That's what we're gonna do this year but we done a bit about that last year, yeah. "
participant10,34,Interviewer ,"Okay, alright. And so did they talk about the actual what your testicles do? Like, what the function of them is? "
participant10,35, Interviewee ,"A little bit, I think. "
participant10,36,Interviewer ,"A little, yeah."
participant10,37, Interviewee ,Yeah.
participant10,38,Interviewer ,"And do you think you could clearly state, like, tell me what they do or is it clear in your mind, do you think or--"
participant10,39, Interviewee ,"Yeah, sort of but--yeah, it seems pretty clear. "
participant10,40,Interviewer ,"Yeah, so would you be able to tell us what testicles do or is it slightly awkward to talk about?"
participant10,41, Interviewee ,I don't wanna say it in case its wrong and I don't want to embarrass myself but I'm pretty sure that they produce sperm. 
participant10,42,Interviewer ,"Yeah, absolutely right, yeah. "
participant10,43, Interviewee ,"Yes, that's what I would say. "
participant10,44,Interviewer ,"Yeah, you're absolutely right. Yeah, and you don't need to worry about not saying the right answer in here. This is absolutely--there is no wrong answers and actually--so you said that you'd be a bit worried to be wrong. Is that something that would proba"
participant10,45, Interviewee ,"Yeah, if they're--yeah, because it would be quite embarrassing to not actually know. "
participant10,46,Interviewer ,"Yes, [laughing]. Yeah, yeah, but I guess if no one's ever explained it to you really well, how are you meant to know? 'Cause also, the other thing they do a lot, is produce hormones. And so I don't know if they mentioned that aspect of it as well as the s"
participant10,47, Interviewee ,"Yeah, I knew that they produced hormones. "
participant10,48,Interviewer ,"Yeah, yeah. So do you think that was in the same--was that in your PSHC lessons, do you think, or was it--"
participant10,49, Interviewee ,It's about biology as well. 
participant10,50,Interviewer ,"Yeah, yeah, so you covered a bit of the function and anatomy and things like that, yeah, in biology. Fine, and how do you feel about talking about testicles or balls? "
participant10,51, Interviewee ,"Kind of like, I don't enjoy talking about it but I'm not, like, that bothered with--I don't really--I'm not super-embarrassed about it, I wouldn't say. "
participant10,52,Interviewer ,"Yeah, so if you need to talk about it, you would. Are there situations where you might feel more difficult in talking about things like testicles? "
participant10,53, Interviewee ,"Well, probably in class if specific questions were asked, it would be a bit uncomfortable in a class full of friends and stuff. It would be a bit weird but not that--I've done it before and it's not, like, life-changing. It's just a bit uncomfortable. "
participant10,54,Interviewer ,"Yeah, and so if I was to stand in front of your class and ask the question I asked you, ""What does a testicle do?"" what do you think people would--"
participant10,55, Interviewee ,"Fine, but I think if someone knew it, it would probably be said and probably have giggles. People would probably laugh and stuff, but someone would say it, I think, in my class anyway. "
participant10,56,Interviewer ,"Yeah, yeah. Why do you think people laugh about it? I think you're right, I think they do. But why do you think people have a laugh about it?"
participant10,57, Interviewee ,"It doesn't get talked about that much and people make jokes about balls and stuff like that and just kind of turn it into a funny thing a lot of the time. If not in a PSHE classroom, like, kind of a joke almost. "
participant10,58,Interviewer ,"Yeah, yeah, I think people quite often make jokes. I think you're absolutely right. I'm trying to get to the bottom of why people do make jokes about testicles in the way that it's different from an arm or a leg, isn't it? But I can't quite get to the bot"
participant10,59, Interviewee ,Not that I'm aware of. There might be people I know that do but they've not talked about it. 
participant10,60,Interviewer ,"That's really interesting, yeah, yeah. And what about any famous people? Have you ever heard of any testicular health problems with older people? Or, sorry, famous people I meant maybe more."
participant10,61, Interviewee ,"Don't think so, not that I can think of. "
participant10,62,Interviewer ,"No, that's fine. Okay, so what would you do if you got pain in your testicle? "
participant10,63, Interviewee ,Probably tell Mother. 
participant10,64,Interviewer ,"Yeah. And if you--would you tell her straightaway, do you think, or what would you do?"
participant10,65, Interviewee ,"I'd probably leave it for a couple of days, see if it went away itself. And then if it didn't, then I'd probably tell Mother. "
participant10,66,Interviewer ,"Okay, alright. And why do you think you might leave it?"
participant10,67, Interviewee ,"Just to see 'cause some things a bit of--it's a conversation that would take quite a lot of time and stuff and it's a bit awkward and if it's just gonna go away itself then sometimes I'd feel there's no need to. But then, like, it came back and it go for "
participant10,68,Interviewer ,"Yeah, no, I think you're absolutely right. And do you think you wouldn't want to talk to your Mother--see, you touched on a little bit that you might find it a bit awkward to talk about. Is it the conversation with your Mother? Sorry, I hope you don't min"
participant10,69, Interviewee ,Just 'cause it doesn't get--it's not the thing I would normally have a conversation with Mother about.
participant10,70,Interviewer ,"And what do you think, do you think you'd--sorry, I don't--is your--would you have a conversation more easily with your dad? Or does that make any difference? "
participant10,71, Interviewee ,"Well, I would have that kind of conversation with Dad. I dunno, I just don't. It's more something that I'd talk to Mother about. "
participant10,72,Interviewer ,"Fine, is that 'cause she's a doctor or 'cause she's Mother?"
participant10,73, Interviewee ,"Well, Dad's a doctor too."
participant10,74,Mother ,Your dad is too.
participant10,75,Interviewer ,"Oh, is he as well? You're both doctors, are you? Right. "
participant10,76,Mother ,"I was worried probably because, unfortunately, we are both doctors, is that you might not come to us because we might just kind of go, ""It'll be fine"" for a few days and maybe we don't really take it seriously but, I don't know, do you feel that? That we "
participant10,77, Interviewee ,"For small things. Other parents--well, since you know what--you probably--if I have, like, so last night I had a sore head and my left arm was numb, and then other parents might have been a bit worried about that."
participant10,78,Interviewer ,"They might have been, yeah. "
participant10,79, Interviewee ,"But since, Mother, you know there wasn't anything bad there, I'm completely fine today. "
participant10,80,Mother  ,And I do think that 'cause it'll mean you've ever had a day off school sick because we just say--
participant10,81, Interviewee ,"Say, ""Get on with it""."
participant10,82,Mother  ,"""To school."" Tell you to get on with it. Whereas lots of your friends who maybe don't have medical parents, so I suppose I was a bit concerned that your answer to that question might be ""Mother and Dad don't take me very seriously sometimes. They just tel"
participant10,83, Interviewee ,"Well, no, about that, you've never said that about this testicular thing. "
participant10,84,Mother  ,"No, and I think if you've ever come with, I don't know, remember when you had some breast bud development, do you remember? When you hit puberty and we spoke about that. "
participant10,85,Interviewer ,"Yeah, it's very common. Very common. "
participant10,86,Mother  ,"You were a bit worried about that. And so we just had to really assure you that that was okay, it was just part of puberty. So we do talk about puberty and we have various conversations about things that would happen but I don't think we've ever actually "
participant10,87, Interviewee ,Pretty sure we have. 
participant10,88,Mother  ,Have we? What have we talked about?
participant10,89, Interviewee ,Sports and stuff.
participant10,90,Interviewer ,"Wearing sensible underwear, like, wearing supportive--that kind of stuff or you mean, like--"
participant10,91,Mother  ,I don't--have we? Have we talked about that? 
participant10,92, Interviewee ,I think so.
participant10,93,Mother  ,"Yeah, I think there's a couple of--haven't talked about underwear, I don't think, particularly. "
participant10,94, Interviewee ,I'm not sure. 
participant10,95,Mother  ,"When you and I talk, we have conversations about it 'cause we tend--I tend to use the term your ""chuckies"". We have silly conversations about it. "
participant10,96,Interviewer ,I've never heard that one before. Chuckies.
participant10,97,Mother  ,I think that's a Scottish thing. [laughing] 
participant10,98, Interviewee ,I think Mother's the only person that's ever--
participant10,99,Interviewer ,[laughing] I must be--I've been speaking to quite a lot of people and I've not heard that word before but--
participant10,100, Interviewee ,"Yeah, okay, it's normal, okay. "
participant10,101,Interviewer ,"So I guess the question for me is with that awkwardness about it, there's a part of it that's feeling a bit awkward speaking to your Mother about testicles which is fine. Is there any part of that awkwardness the worry about the next steps and what might "
participant10,102, Interviewee ,"It's just that 'cause someone, like we've already talked about, since someone else's Mother and Dad might take them to a doctor or something like that but I don't have that to worry about, really. Obviously, I would if it was serious but for something tha"
participant10,103,Interviewer ,"Fine. You just kind of, your first port of call is mostly to see your parents and just they'll help you with any health issues you have."
participant10,104, Interviewee ,"Yeah, I'd say so. "
participant10,105,Interviewer ,"Yeah, and what happens if you weren't with your parents? Say, you're at school, it's 10 o'clock in the morning and suddenly you get, shall I say, I use the word ""excruciating"" pain that isn't going away. What would you do in that situation? "
participant10,106, Interviewee ,"I dunno. I wouldn't feel comfortable talking to a teacher, I don't think. Just be something that would--never thought of that, really. Obviously, it's never happened and that would be a lot worse than it happening in the house. "
participant10,107,Interviewer ,"Yeah, what about if it was at 2 in the morning? What would you do if it was 2 in the morning and you woke up and it was excruciating? "
participant10,108, Interviewee ,"Probably just wake up Mother, I'd say. I wouldn't really want to 'cause it would mean that you'd be very tired the next day."
participant10,109,Mother  ,And grumpy. 
participant10,110, Interviewee ,"And a bit grumpy, yeah."
participant10,111,Interviewer ,Don't you worry. I've heard before grumpy parents as an excuse for not waking someone up at 2 in the morning. It's very common. So the thing that I--but a part of the reason I'm doing this project is because there's a thing called testicular torsion. And 
participant10,112, Interviewee ,No.
participant10,113,Interviewer ,It's also sometimes called twisted testicle. Have you ever heard of this before? 
participant10,114, Interviewee ,No.
participant10,115,Interviewer ,"So I'm actually a surgeon at the big hospital. And one of the operations I have to do is when young men get a twisted testicle, they come in and I do an operation to fix it so to untwist it. And for me, the real problem is, is that if I don't untwist the "
participant10,116, Interviewee  ,What is a twisted testicle? 
participant10,117,Interviewer ,"So if you think, your testicle, the way it sits is you have your testicle and so the sperm tube which is where the sperm goes that way and the blood supply down to the testicle, it hangs on it. So it's a terrible design but, anyway, it's how they're desig"
participant10,118, Interviewee ,"Oh, I see. "
participant10,119,Interviewer ,"Yeah, and so if that comes on, you just need to have an operation. There's nothing really very much else to do. And I'd--trying to find out how I can improve people's getting to hospital so that if I do the operation then I put a--if it doesn't look dead,"
participant10,120, Interviewee ,"Yes, when I was very small. "
participant10,121,Interviewer ,"Okay, so."
participant10,122, Interviewee ,"But I've not had--no, not when I can remember. "
participant10,123,Interviewer ,"No, fine. And how do you feel about hospitals? Have you ever been to hospital?"
participant10,124, Interviewee ,I don't go often because of Mother and Dad but I've been to hospital--
participant10,125,Mother  ,We don't treat you for things at home. 
participant10,126,Interviewer ,"No, I appreciate that. "
participant10,127,Mother ,You’ve been well. You've kept well and we don't generally take you to see the GP because usually we're--
participant10,128,Interviewer ,"Your Mother's worried that I'm gonna think she's negligent. That's what she's worried about. [laughing] Don't worry. If you needed to, you'd go to hospital but you probably don't need to see a GP."
participant10,129,Mother ,"I don't know if you want me to at this point, so [name] was diagnosed with juvenile idiopathic arthropathy when he was about 2 and had his ankle aspirated under GA which I think is the only general anaesthetic operation you've ever had. You had quite a lo"
participant10,130,Mother ,As you sat on the slit lamp
participant10,131,No 10 ,Oh the motorbike?
participant10,132,Mother ,We used to call it the motorbike and you used to sit on the slit lamp and had your anterior chambers looked at because of the risk of uveitis. But then you were discharged at age 9 so you haven't been back to York Hill probably since then. But then you al
participant10,133,Interviewer ,"You've got a memory like me. I'm the same. I'm, like, ""Oh, it happened a couple of years ago."""
participant10,134,Mother  ,"I remember that because you were at school and stuff like that when we were going back and forward there, on oral antibiotics and almost got to sort of oral Roaccutane stage but didn't need that drug in the end. Do you remember? "
participant10,135,Interviewer ,"Well, that's fine. So you--"
participant10,136,Mother  ,So you've been in and out of hospital appointments as an outpatient for a couple of reasons but probably not for the last 5 years maybe. 
participant10,137, Interviewee ,Yeah. 
participant10,138,Interviewer ,"So doesn't sound like you've got bad experiences, anyway. And how would you feel if I was to say that so if you did have this condition, you'd need to have an operation and stay overnight? Would that worry you? Or do you think that's just like, well, you "
participant10,139, Interviewee ,Get a day off school.
participant10,140,Interviewer ,"Yeah, quite. So you'd be quite--I can't just admit you for that reason but--yeah, no, fair enough. Fair enough. "
participant10,141, Interviewee ,"I wouldn't want to do it just for a day off school, obviously, 'cause it wouldn't really be fun. "
participant10,142,Interviewer ,"No, fair enough. If you come to hospital, a doctor would have to have a look at your balls. Would that bother you? "
participant10,143, Interviewee ,"Probably, yeah, a bit. It would just be a bit weird. "
participant10,144,Interviewer ,"Yeah, but not enough to stop you coming to hospital if you need to?"
participant10,145, Interviewee ,For my health it would be important.
participant10,146,Interviewer ,And would it bother you if you had a girl doctor or a boy doctor treating you? 
participant10,147, Interviewee ,"No, I don't think so. I think both would be just as weird, just as kind of a bit different. "
participant10,148,Interviewer ,"So do you have any health--I say the word ""health conversations"", it sounds a bit weird but do you talk to your mates about any health issues? Are there any things that you'd talk to your friends about? "
participant10,149, Interviewee ,ummm…..Any health issues at all? 
participant10,150,Interviewer ,"Yeah, like, anything. I was thinking that maybe young people don't have conversations with their mates about testicles. Fine, but then I kind of got to thinking, well, do you have any conversations with your friends about health issues?"
participant10,151, Interviewee ,I have conversations with my friends about stuff like pulled muscles or injuries that would affect playing football.
participant10,152,Interviewer ,"So quite a lot of sports and injuries, yes. Yeah, absolutely, and I guess that's 'cause you've had experience of them."
participant10,153, Interviewee ,"Yeah, and, like, everyone, like, people, yeah. That's basically."
participant10,154,Interviewer ,"Yeah, injuries and stuff and broken bones. Have any of your mates had operations for broken bones?"
participant10,155, Interviewee ,"Yeah, hm-mm."
participant10,156,Interviewer ,"Yeah, so a while ago you did mention that you think that maybe if any of your friends had had an operation for their testicle they might not tell you, do you remember? Do you think that's probably the case, if one of your mates had an operation for a twis"
participant10,157, Interviewee ,"I don't know if I would tell my friends, really. I wouldn't--or I mean, I might but I don't think I would go into school, like, looking to tell someone. "
participant10,158,Interviewer ,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. But if you'd broken your arm, I guess, normally obvious 'cause you've got a pot or whatever, yeah, a cast on. But it wouldn't be awkward talking about that, would it? "
participant10,159, Interviewee ,No. 
participant10,160,Interviewer ,But it might be a bit awkward talking about a testicular operation? 
participant10,161, Interviewee ,Yeah. 
participant10,162,Interviewer ,And why do you think those two things are different? 
participant10,163, Interviewee ,"Because, I don't know. 'Cause I think your arm is always on show and everyone notices your arms but it's a bit different with your testicles. And I mean, reasonably, they're always hidden away, almost."
participant10,164,Interviewer ,"Yeah, absolutely. Hidden away and then you're not really encouraged to talk about them either, very much. No, I think you're absolutely right. Yeah, no, you're absolutely right with that. It is different. I can't--just trying to work out exactly why is in"
participant10,165, Interviewee ,Yeah.
participant10,166,Interviewer ,"Yeah, and do you know anyone or any experiences of testicular cancer? Have you ever heard of this? "
participant10,167, Interviewee ,"No, just that there cancer--"
participant10,168,Interviewer ,"No, and do you know what the recommendations would be for yourself in terms of examination? Have you heard of this before ever? Like, the self-examination?"
participant10,169, Interviewee ,"No, I don't think so. "
participant10,170,Interviewer ,"No, okay, so it's basically exactly what you think. That probably, they say, about once a month. Now, it's one of these things where exact timing doesn't matter but you can pick up lumps or bumps in your testicles and if that was the case, you'd need to t"
participant10,171, Interviewee ,No. 
participant10,172,Interviewer ,"And you weren't aware of that, no? So I think there's quite a lot of information out there about testicles for adults, but I don't think that it's very well designed for younger people, like yourself. I think that. So one of the big things is so with the "
participant10,173, Interviewee ,"Well, I think the most effective way to get, to actually be able to communicate to everyone, would be at school. Like, we've had people, during PSHE, we've had people, like, come in and talk about different specific things that they want to raise awarenes"
participant10,174,Interviewer ,"Yeah, I think you're right. And can I ask, your mixed classes and for your PSHCE as well, do you do it all mixed? Have you had any lessons where you've been separate? "
participant10,175, Interviewee ,"No, no."
participant10,176,Interviewer ,"I also, my personal choice is to ask you first but I'm not sure that you'd need to have separate classes for testicular health because if you're not gonna have testicles you might have sons, so I think everyone, really, needs to know about it, really. So "
participant10,177, Interviewee ,"Not really, no. Not sure, I don't think so. "
participant10,178,Mother  ,"You certainly, obviously, through social--use a lot of social media. "
participant10,179,Interviewer ,"Well, that's why, exactly. So yeah. "
participant10,180,Mother ,"And watch TV a lot. And you do ask me about advertising for certain things if you see something that you don't know about, quite often ask me about it. Just thinking along those lines. If advertising campaigns and things like that that might catch your ey"
participant10,181,Interviewer ,"So yeah, what accounts do you have at the moment? "
participant10,182, Interviewee ,In social media I just basically use Instagram and Snapchat. I have a Facebook account but I don't like..
participant10,183,Mother ,"To keep an eye on me, really.  "
participant10,184,Interviewer ,"Sure, no, someone needs to. "
participant10,185, Interviewee ,I only got a Facebook account--
participant10,186,Mother  ,You don't really use it. 
participant10,187, Interviewee ,"I got it to play a game with my friends that you had to have a Facebook account to play online, like, a lot of the game (overtalk 25:56). That was the only reason I got Facebook."
participant10,188,Interviewer ,"So you use your--from what you've said--if I've got this wrong, tell me, but so those are more about keeping in contact with your friends, isn't it? Rather than finding information, those accounts?"
participant10,189, Interviewee ,"Well, Instagram is more like a photo sharing thing. Snapchat's just a messaging site. "
participant10,190,Interviewer ,"Yeah, but you wouldn't--could you search Instagram? I mean, if you were wanting to find out, say, you had testicular pain and you were, like, ""What is this?"" Instagram wouldn't--would that work? You wouldn't particularly search that, would you? "
participant10,191, Interviewee ,"If I was gonna do that, I don't think I would, but if I was gonna search up I would just go on the Internet rather than Instagram."
participant10,192,Interviewer ,"Yeah, so google it or whatever. You said that you probably wouldn't 'cause you've probably got a fountain of knowledge here but--or do you think is there anything else that would stop you using, like, a general Internet search? "
participant10,193, Interviewee ,On Instagram or just like--
participant10,194,Interviewer ,"On anything. Like, you know, so, yeah, I've got testicular pain and you said you probably wouldn't, just like, put it in a search on the Internet or do you think--"
participant10,195, Interviewee ,"I wouldn't because I'd probably just ask Mother but also I don't think there's any other reason. Like, if I couldn't ask Mother, I would probably search it out but there's nothing else that would stop me, really, I don't think. "
participant10,196,Interviewer ,"Fine, it's not that you don't trust what your sources come up or whatever, like that?"
participant10,197, Interviewee ,"Well, I know not to believe everything I see and not to just click on the first thing that comes up and, just like, if I've got a cough and I could search that all for a cough and I sweat I could come up with I'm gonna die tomorrow or something. "
participant10,198,Interviewer ,"Yes, absolutely. Think that's probably very true. Absolutely right. Fantastic. What would you do? I mean, you've obviously had a medical education. "
participant10,199,Mother  ,"But didn't know any of the statistics, like, presentations and younger people and things like that. So it's fascinating for me and absolutely something that I've never spoken to [name] about and we have a reasonably open relationship. We talk about lots o"
participant10,200,Interviewer ,"It's relatively--talk about medical stuff for a second, but it's relatively common, you know? Like, it's not--some people say, ""One in 860 boys will have it between 0 and 25,"" which is--I think that was a little bit generous but that means in your class o"
participant10,201,Mother  ,That's quite significant. I don't think I'd appreciated that the instance was as high as that. 
participant10,202,Interviewer ,"I'm not quite sure that that isn't necessarily right but, yes, it's more common. This is from today, it's not to go away and think, ""Oh my gosh, your balls are definitely gonna twist."" It's not that. But I just--it does mean, though, if you do have pain o"
participant10,203,Mother  ,"Even the flyer that you had today, I don't know, did you hand it out in person, that revealed--"
participant10,204,Interviewer ,"Yes, yes, I did, yes. "
participant10,205,Mother ,"Even things like that, I suppose do raise awareness and that was a really punchy headline. It certainly grabbed your attention, along with the £15. "
participant10,206,Interviewer ,"Yeah, no, that's good. That's good. There's the two attention--"
participant10,207,Mother  ,"--grabbed your attention but add that, we definitely--and it started the conversation. So I suppose, even sort of looking at, obviously, you talked about input into schools but also maybe input into places like sports clubs, youth clubs. "
participant10,208,Interviewer ,"'Cause I think young athletes as well tend to--you're used to a bit of groin pain and actually--well, part of the reason I did this is I treated somebody who was a sportsman, a footballer, who had, you know, I said, had lost both testes and he thought it "
participant10,209,Mother  ,"But I think in terms of raising awareness and even starting the conversation, have you spoken to other guys that were at training that night, if they were gonna be contacting (overtalk 31:35) what is this all about?"
participant10,210,Interviewer ,"Did anyone say what they thought it was gonna be about? You can also say the rude things. [laughing] If there was anything rude, you'll--"
participant10,211,Mother  ,Its not a test
participant10,212,Interviewer ,"Yeah, I know, exactly."
participant10,213, Interviewee ,"There was jokes made about it and stuff like that but, like, everyone kind of guessed it would be, like, a sort of survey thing."
participant10,214,Mother  ,What sort of jokes were made about it? 
participant10,215, Interviewee ,Just different kind of jokes. 
participant10,216,Interviewer ,"Fine, fine. You can tell us if you like but also, no, if you don't want to, that's no problems. Fine, fine. Well, is there anything else 'cause I think those are really the main things that I wanted to talk to you about and I think what you've said has be"
participant10,217, Interviewee ,What are you thinking? 
participant10,218,Mother  ,"Just thinking so obviously with the roll-out at primary school and the Glasgow City Council schools, it was called SHRE, wasn't it, the SHRE program, Sexual Health and Reproduction Education. And I think that was quite controversial when that was introduc"
participant10,219, Interviewee ,"It was quite interesting so when I went to Jordanhill Secondary, Jordanhill Primary"
participant10,220,Mother  ,Had quite a different approach.
participant10,221, Interviewee ,"I've had quite a different, like, sort of--"
participant10,222,Mother  ,'Cause they're not a Glasgow City Council school and so haven't had any of this SHRE throughout primary school so they literally come to--
participant10,223, Interviewee ,"Less I would say they would know less, basically. "
participant10,224,Mother  ,"With less, definitely with less knowledge."
participant10,225,Interviewer ,"That's brilliant. Do you think having the words helps you 'cause I was wondering a bit, like, you know, you're talking about that kind of labelling anatomy and stuff like that. I was wondering how helpful that really was in terms of real practice but then"
participant10,226, Interviewee ,"I can't remember what I said, right, something you asked with that. If I thought that was helpful versus just learning. It feels more important than some of the things I learn in school but it's not, like, yeah. It is more just--can't really describe it. "
participant10,227,Mother  ,Gonna make the difference. 
participant10,228, Interviewee ,Can't even remember all but I don't think if I tried to label just now but--
participant10,229,Mother  ,So knowing the labels wouldn't increase or decrease the chance of you going to someone if you had pain?
participant10,230, Interviewee ,No.
participant10,231,Interviewer ,"Exactly. And I wonder just, and then this might be something, I don't know--are you--you're in the community? You're a GP? I also wonder, has anyone ever talked to you about how to go to a GP, how to go to hospital? 'Cause I also think that also some peop"
participant10,232,Mother ,Access healthcare. 
participant10,233,Interviewer ,Do you think you'd ever call an ambulance if you had bad testicular pain? 
participant10,234, Interviewee ,I don't think I would call an ambulance. 
participant10,235,Interviewer ,"No, but, yeah, and do you know if you're allowed to call an ambulance?"
participant10,236, Interviewee ,"I wouldn't--no, I don't know if I'd be able to call an ambulance."
participant10,237,Interviewer ,"Yeah, things like that. "
participant10,238,Mother  ,"Yeah, that's interesting. You've answered that differently. "
participant10,239, Interviewee ,"I really wouldn't want to call an ambulance for that. That would just be, like--it would just be so--"
participant10,240,Interviewer ,"Funny to speak to someone on the phone you don't know and be, like--"
participant10,241, Interviewee ,"I need an ambulance and I've got sore balls. It could be nothing. You'd be scared it was nothing and then they'd turn up and it would just be, like, ""You're fine."" "
participant10,242,Interviewer ,That would be embarrassing. 
participant10,243, Interviewee ,"Yeah, exactly. "
participant10,244,Interviewer ,"Yeah, yeah, absolutely. "
participant10,245,Mother  ,I would have imagined that you would have been more than likely to call an ambulance. That you wouldn't feel maybe--
participant10,246, Interviewee ,"Calling 111 or something. No, that's not the--what's the one that--what's the number for the NHS24 thing?"
participant10,247,Mother ,1--
participant10,248, Interviewee ,"It's either 11 or 101, something like that."
participant10,249,Mother  ,So it's 111. 101 is the police if it's not non-Americans.
participant10,250,Interviewer ,"So you can call an ambulance if you were in a bad situation and you were on your own and the ambulance would do everything they can to look after you 'cause you are under 16 but you could. And I'm not suggesting that, you know--if you were worried and you"
participant10,251,Mother ,Absolutely. I'm actually--
participant10,252, Interviewee ,"Calling an ambulances and phoning 999 is always, like, ""Don't do it unless it's a proper emergency."" "
participant10,253,Mother ,But the problem is you might not appreciate it is a proper emergency. You might be a bit inhibited by thinking that's a bit embarrassing.
participant10,254,Interviewer ,"Yeah, exactly. "
participant10,255,Mother  ,Whereas if you had--
participant10,256,Interviewer ,"I mean, you probably mostly gonna be with your Mother or dad. It's probably very rare chance that it would be something that you would need to but that's interesting. "
participant10,257,Mother  ,"Yeah, absolutely. I thought you'd be way more likely to, but yeah, that's interesting."
participant10,258,Interviewer ,"Great. Alright, then. So I think if that's okay, that's all the questions I really wanted to ask. Is there anything you'd like to ask me? "
participant10,259, Interviewee ,"No, I don't think so. "
participant10,260,Interviewer ,"Okay, grand. Well, I will stop this."
participant11,1,Interviewer ,So if I just leave that little device for me. It’s just in the background. Let me put that there. Erm ... so my name’s Interviewer and is it Tom is that right?
participant11,2, Interviewee,Yes. Participant. 
participant11,3,Interviewer ,Yeah. Participant. Erm... and have you chatted to any of the other guys who have done this with me already?
participant11,4, Interviewee,Er yeah just to say like they’ve done and that’s it. 
participant11,5,Interviewer ,Fine. And have you talked about like what we talked about in the interviews or not particularly?
participant11,6, Interviewee,No not really.
participant11,7,Interviewer ,"No, OK. Alright. So first of all its we’re talking about about testicular and testicular health. And what word to you tend to use for testicles? "
participant11,8, Interviewee,"Ah, just balls. "
participant11,9,Interviewer ,Balls yeah?
participant11,10, Interviewee,Yeah.
participant11,11,Interviewer ,And would you use the same word when you are talking to your parents and your friends or would you use different words in different situations?
participant11,12, Interviewee,Erm no just probably the same.
participant11,13,Interviewer ,Probably the same. So balls generally is the word you’d use in most situations?
participant11,14, Interviewee,Yeah. 
participant11,15,Interviewer ,Fine. And do you know what health problems you could have with your balls?
participant11,16, Interviewee,"Erm, yeah like if you damage them quite a bit then like you might not be able to have kids. "
participant11,17,Interviewer ,"OK, yeah. Absolutely yeah, yeah, yeah. And so when you say damage, what kind of damage have you heard about before with testicles or balls?"
participant11,18, Interviewee,"Erm, just like if you just, I don’t know if something hits you hard."
participant11,19,Interviewer ,So like an injury?
participant11,20, Interviewee,Yeah. Yeah.
participant11,21,Interviewer ,"Yeah, absolutely right. Yes and is that something that you know about because you know about it, it’s been taught to you, you’ve have experience of it or how do you know about that?"
participant11,22, Interviewee,"I just know and we’ve had, I think we’ve had a little chat about in P7 I think."
participant11,23,Interviewer ,And what was the... like where did you have your lessons? Was the lessons like...?
participant11,24, Interviewee,It was sex education. 
participant11,25,Interviewer ,Sex education fine. And what did they talk to you about with testicles during those lessons?
participant11,26, Interviewee,"Erm it was just like just talking about, just like where the sperms held and all that. "
participant11,27,Interviewer ,"Fine, so you were talking about their function?"
participant11,28, Interviewee,Yeah. 
participant11,29,Interviewer ,"Yeah, yeah. And did you talk about anything else or was it just the sperm you talked about? Did you talk about their other functions?"
participant11,30, Interviewee,No probably just that I think. 
participant11,31,Interviewer ,"Right, fine and did they say they are quite important for hormones as well. Does that sound like something..."
participant11,32, Interviewee,Erm...
participant11,33,Interviewer ,... you’ve been taught about or...?
participant11,34, Interviewee,"Er, I don’t think we’ve been taught that, no. Well I’ve not done my sex education like for this year. Like just now. I’ll be doing it in a couple of weeks I think."
participant11,35,Interviewer ,Right. 
participant11,36, Interviewee,Cos we do a rotation thing.
participant11,37,Interviewer ,Um.
participant11,38, Interviewee,And I don’t know if we’ll get to talk about that.
participant11,39,Interviewer ,Yeah. 
participant11,40, Interviewee,I’m not sure.
participant11,41,Interviewer ,"And so your lessons, is it called Share or is it that kind of curriculum or is that what it is or is your lessons called your Sex Ed in your...?"
participant11,42, Interviewee,It’s PSE. So we do like a number of different things in sex ed. and it’s one of them. 
participant11,43,Interviewer ,"Fine. Fine and so all the information you’ve had about balls and like the hormones and sperm has that been in your social, like PSE or has it been in like your Biology in your science lessons or is it like been in..."
participant11,44, Interviewee,Just PSE. Just a couple of years ago we just talked about doing it now. It’s just we’ve just started doing it now. 
participant11,45,Interviewer ,So you’ve had a bit more information may be?
participant11,46, Interviewee,Yeah. 
participant11,47,Interviewer ,"So you obviously know a bit about some of the functions. That sounds really good. Do you remember what kind of lessons they were like? What were they like kind of discussions, videos, drawings...?"
participant11,48, Interviewee,Some videos. 
participant11,49,Interviewer ,Videos. Yeah and kind of to do with like puberty and stuff like that?
participant11,50, Interviewee,Yeah.
participant11,51,Interviewer ,That kind of stuff?
participant11,52, Interviewee,Yeah.
participant11,53,Interviewer ,"Yeah, fine. Fine, erm so you said a bit about how you can get an injury in your testicle which is absolutely right. "
participant11,54, Interviewee,Um. Yeah.
participant11,55,Interviewer ,You can get an injury and then you said if that happens you might have problems with having children in later life. 
participant11,56, Interviewee,"Yeah, oh yeah."
participant11,57,Interviewer ,Is that something that you kind of a bit you know? 
participant11,58, Interviewee,Yeah. Ah ha yeah.
participant11,59,Interviewer ,Do you know about like the problems like your symptoms you could have? Do you know like what kind of symptoms you can get with your testicles?
participant11,60, Interviewee,No.
participant11,61,Interviewer ,"Ok. So if I was to say to you, you all of a sudden got quite a bad pain in your testicle or one or the other or just in the area. Do you know what we might worry about with pain that comes on without any warning?"
participant11,62, Interviewee,No. No I’m not sure. No.
participant11,63,Interviewer ,So fine. So if it didn’t worry you all that much do you not think you might some idea or...?
participant11,64, Interviewee,"Er, well, what do you mean like? Do you mean would you like. Do you mean you might have cancer there or something like that?"
participant11,65,Interviewer ,OK. So that’s really interesting.
participant11,66, Interviewee,Yeah. 
participant11,67,Interviewer ,"So would that may be... So if right now, you’re sitting there and then all of a sudden you’ve got a pain in your testicle. I know it’s slightly unusual but If that was to happen, so you’re... What do think would run through your head? What do you think yo"
participant11,68, Interviewee,"Just, I don’t know may be go and have them looked at them."
participant11,69,Interviewer ,"Yeah. Yes. that seems a very sensible thing. So you would have a look and may be if there was may be nothing out or may be a little bit of redness, what would you do, do you think just then?"
participant11,70, Interviewee,Just wait a couple of days probably. 
participant11,71,Interviewer ,"OK, OK. And why do you think you would wait with?"
participant11,72, Interviewee,Cos it might just be something small and it might just go. 
participant11,73,Interviewer ,OK. And what would be bad about if you were to say something and then if it was something small and it was to go away. That would be something that you wouldn’t be like very happy about. You would obviously want to avoid that. Is that right?
participant11,74, Interviewee,Yeah.
participant11,75,Interviewer ,Yeah. And why do you think that is?
participant11,76, Interviewee,Erm because just... If it just went away then I wouldn’t really worry about it
participant11,77,Interviewer ,Yeah?
participant11,78, Interviewee,Yeah.
participant11,79,Interviewer ,"Cos I guess sometimes you have a bit of pain that goes away? And that that’s something, especially if you do sports I guess you get a bit of pain..."
participant11,80, Interviewee,Yeah.
participant11,81,Interviewer ,... and sometimes and it goes away.
participant11,82, Interviewee,"Yeah, oh yeah."
participant11,83,Interviewer ,"But say, it’s not going away and it’s kind of on-going. Do you think... What would be the thing that would make you go, Ah, actually I should say something or I should do something about this?"
participant11,84, Interviewee,"If it’s just likes, I don’t know if it looks quite bad or it’s like really painful. "
participant11,85,Interviewer ,Yeah.
participant11,86, Interviewee,Then I would probably say something.
participant11,87,Interviewer ,"Yeah. Yeah, yeah And what would be your first port of call? Who do you think you would talk to?"
participant11,88, Interviewee,I might just ask my Mother to make me a doctor’s appointment.
participant11,89,Interviewer ,"Yeah OK. Fine, so again you would probably speak may be to your Mother. May be your dad cos I know that your dad’s sitting here but..."
participant11,90, Interviewee,Yes. 
participant11,91,Interviewer ,"What would you do, you’d talk to your Mother first? Is that cos she tends to deal with more with like your health and things?"
participant11,92, Interviewee,Yeah. 
participant11,93,Interviewer ,Would you speak to your dad? Would that make any difference?
participant11,94, Interviewee,"Erm, I don’t know. I normally just speak to my Mother on those things to be honest. "
participant11,95,Interviewer ,Yeah. Yeah. And I guess cos your dad’s here. What would you think if... What would you do if you’re son said that he had painful testicles or pain in his testicle. What kind of things would be running through your head?
participant11,96,Dad ,"Yeah, I would. Well I’d probably ascertain whether or not he’s bit hit."
participant11,97,Interviewer ,Yeah.
participant11,98,Dad ,Playing sport. Erm and er but I would if it’s. I think if he said it doesn’t go away then we just make an appointment to see the GP. 
participant11,99,Interviewer ,Yeah. 
participant11,100,Dad ,We’d have no hesitation in doing that. 
participant11,101,Interviewer ,"Yeah, right. So it would be your family doctor you’d probably go to your family doctor. And have you seen your family doctor cos often young fit people, young fit men. Have you ever, have you met your family doctor or you seen them many times?"
participant11,102,Dad ,"Yeah, he’s been a couple of times. It’s a practice though it not necessarily a single doctor that we are seeing. You know whoever’s free at the time."
participant11,103, Interviewee,Yeah. 
participant11,104,Dad ,So yeah so we’ve been a couple of times and we’ve only been here for three years...
participant11,105,Interviewer ,"Right, Fine. "
participant11,106,Dad ,So we’ve been to the family practice only a few times. It’s been very different before but this is like...
participant11,107,Interviewer ,Um.
participant11,108,Dad ,... a slightly different set up...
participant11,109,Interviewer ,Yeah.
participant11,110,Dad ,... I think 
participant11,111,Interviewer ,"Fine. So and if the pain... So if you had pain you would probably see if it’s anything obvious, speak to your Mother, maybe and probably see your General Practitioner. See your doctor. Would there be anything that would make you go to hospital instead of "
participant11,112, Interviewee,"Er, if it was... I don’t know. If it was like really really painful then..."
participant11,113,Interviewer ,Yeah.
participant11,114, Interviewee,... I would probably go to the hospital.
participant11,115,Interviewer ,Cos the thing I’m worried about and have you ever heard of testicular torsion?
participant11,116, Interviewee,No.
participant11,117,Interviewer ,OK and have you ever heard of a twisted testicle or twisted ball?
participant11,118, Interviewee,Um. No.
participant11,119,Interviewer ,Did you know this could happen?
participant11,120, Interviewee,No.
participant11,121,Interviewer ,"OK, alright. So the first thing is to say is that it isn’t something to be... You know I’m not coming here make or startle you but there’s something that’s called a twisted testicle. Erm that comes on in people in a bad way and you’re the most common age "
participant11,122,Dad ,Brother.
participant11,123,Interviewer ,"Brother. So. So... from my point of view, I’m a surgeon and I do the operations when these things happen and one of the problems is, is that if the testicle twists, it cuts off its own blood supply. Cos if you imagine it sits on its own blood supply. So y"
participant11,124, Interviewee,Um.
participant11,125,Interviewer ,And I have no reason why cos it seems something that. 
participant11,126,Dad ,Very common and why is that?
participant11,127,Interviewer ,"You’d have thought well in... Well so again, it’s a young person’s disease. Up to about nought to about twenty five. "
participant11,128,Dad ,Oh right. 
participant11,129,Interviewer ,About one in eight hundred. So it’s not the most common thing. 
participant11,130,Dad ,Um.
participant11,131,Interviewer ,And that means that in your school there will be a couple of young men who’ve been through this experience.
participant11,132,Dad ,Um.
participant11,133,Interviewer ,So that’s your risk between nought and about twenty-five. And about one in eight hundred. Erm so... but it does happen.
participant11,134,Dad ,Yeah.
participant11,135,Interviewer ,And it such a simple thing for me to sort if you can get to hospital in time.
participant11,136,Dad ,Um.
participant11,137,Interviewer ,But if you get to hospital too late then there’s just nothing I can do which is really disappointing.
participant11,138,Dad ,"So then I suppose would it be, would be quite painful?"
participant11,139,Interviewer ,"Yes, very painful definitely. "
participant11,140,Dad ,"We’d certainly have no qualms about going to hospital, A & E. "
participant11,141,Interviewer ,Yeah.
participant11,142,Dad ,NHS 24.
participant11,143,Interviewer ,Yeah.
participant11,144,Dad ,Out of hours. I don’t know. Whatever it might be really.
participant11,145,Interviewer ,Yes.
participant11,146,Dad ,We have done that may be once with sports injuries essentially. 
participant11,147,Interviewer ,Yeah.
participant11,148,Dad ,But anything else we if we can’t get access to the GP we know where to go that sort of thing and so. 
participant11,149,Interviewer ,That’s good. Cos I think as well young people who do sports seem to have sometimes more delays because I think they are a bit more used to getting a bit of groin strains or a bit more hardy so it’s particularly in young athletes as well we seem to have a 
participant11,150, Interviewee,"I don’t, I think some people might think it’s embarrassing. "
participant11,151,Interviewer ,Um.
participant11,152, Interviewee,"I don’t, yeah. The main thing it’s embarrassing so they might not go and it would just get worse. "
participant11,153,Interviewer ,Um. Um.
participant11,154, Interviewee,So. 
participant11,155,Interviewer ,"Um, um um And why do you think it’s embarrassing? Or well not you necessarily but why do you think young people might find it embarrassing?"
participant11,156, Interviewee,I don’t know. It’s quite like a sensitive thing.
participant11,157,Interviewer ,"Um, um. And a bit shy about it. "
participant11,158, Interviewee,Yeah.
participant11,159,Interviewer ,May be something they don’t talk about very much either. 
participant11,160, Interviewee,Yeah. 
participant11,161,Interviewer ,"OK, alright. OK And it’s an operation that we have to do. Do you think that any part of it kind of hospitals, operations, do you think that affects whether people would come to hospital?"
participant11,162, Interviewee,Erm...
participant11,163,Interviewer ,If they have a painful testicle?
participant11,164, Interviewee,Probably not.
participant11,165,Interviewer ,No. And do you think it would make a difference if you were seeing a male doctor or a female doctor or anything like that? Do you think that would?
participant11,166, Interviewee,May be for some people but I don’t know. Not for me. I just...
participant11,167,Interviewer ,Um. Yeah. So do you know of any other problems you can have with your testicles? 
participant11,168, Interviewee,Um.
participant11,169,Interviewer ,Anything you mentioned that you want to talk about it?
participant11,170, Interviewee,Just the children thing that’s all I know to be honest. 
participant11,171,Interviewer ,Yeah. Yeah. If you lose one testicle erm you still have a good chance of having children. But you obviously have a slightly decreased but overall it tends to be OK. And you mentioned something else? Do you know what else? Have you ever had or been told ab
participant11,172, Interviewee,Like lumps or?
participant11,173,Interviewer ,"Yeah. Yeah. Definitely, exactly right. And again have you been told that directly ever by anyone or have you just picked it up?"
participant11,174, Interviewee,"I just picked it up probably. Yeah, we’ve not been taught that at school or anything, yeah. "
participant11,175,Interviewer ,And why do you think you might have picked... and why do you think you found out about testicular cancer from?
participant11,176, Interviewee,"Um. I’ve just known like if you’ve got a lump or anything, that’s not good. "
participant11,177,Interviewer ,Yeah and so have you been told what the guidelines are and do you know what you are meant to do about if you have a lump do you know?
participant11,178, Interviewee,Just go to the doctors.
participant11,179,Interviewer ,And so if you found a lump. And do you know what anything about the guidelines that how to work out if you’ve got a lump? Has anyone talked to you about self examination? 
participant11,180, Interviewee,No.
participant11,181,Interviewer ,No and has no one told you about how often you should be doing that?
participant11,182, Interviewee,No. 
participant11,183,Interviewer ,"Not really. So erm the guidelines are about once a month. So it doesn’t have to be, you know, it’s one of these things just the kind of timeframe roughly. So you do it relative regularly but you still, know a lump will develop. So you know what your testi"
participant11,184, Interviewee,Yeah.
participant11,185,Interviewer ,... any of these problems. It’s more just so that to find out a bit about your knowledge and then if anything did happen to any of your friends. Then it would be a kind of thing that were you would have a bit of expertise and you could help. So have any o
participant11,186, Interviewee,Just go to the big hospital. 
participant11,187,Interviewer ,"Yeah, Yeah, yeah. That’s right, absolutely. Do you talk to your friends about any health problems? "
participant11,188, Interviewee,No.
participant11,189,Interviewer ,"Not really. Yeah, I was thinking that because why don’t people have wider conversations about testicles. And then I thought, well do you... would you have a conversation about Appendicitis or any kind of illness?"
participant11,190, Interviewee,"No not really. We just, no."
participant11,191,Interviewer ,What about injuries. I guess some of your mates have had like...
participant11,192, Interviewee,Yeah.
participant11,193,Interviewer ,... pretty serious injuries and broken arms and...
participant11,194, Interviewee,"Yeah, stuff like that. Yeah we sometimes talk about that if someone’s got an injury. "
participant11,195,Interviewer ,Yeah.
participant11,196, Interviewee,But not anything like other things. Just injuries.
participant11,197,Interviewer ,"Do you think you would tell your mates if you... If you had a twisted testicle and you’d had an operation, do you think you would tell your mates?"
participant11,198, Interviewee,Er... probably not to be honest.
participant11,199,Interviewer ,You would probably keep that.
participant11,200, Interviewee,Yeah. 
participant11,201,Interviewer ,And why do you think that cos that seems different from an injury?
participant11,202, Interviewee,"Yeah, I was just. I don’t know. I wouldn’t feel comfortable I think if everyone knew, so. "
participant11,203,Interviewer ,"Yeah. Yeah, yeah I can see that. That’s sort of something you may be wana keep private a bit. "
participant11,204, Interviewee,Yeah.
participant11,205,Interviewer ,Yeah. Yeah I think that’s really why. I’m not quite sure how testicles... This is different from an injury obviously but erm just trying to get to the bottom of how maybe I can improve that for people who find that more difficult. Cos what would you think
participant11,206, Interviewee,Um.
participant11,207,Interviewer ,... you get different problems really.
participant11,208, Interviewee,"Yeah, like you could probably like go round the schools. Go to schools and tell them about it or like put it in to their like sex education like programme thing."
participant11,209,Interviewer ,"Yeah, so you think schools is a good environment to do it? I sometimes wonder I think it’s nice to be in a more family space. Erm but schools you think would be good wouldn’t it to..."
participant11,210, Interviewee,Yeah.
participant11,211,Interviewer ,You’d take notice if someone says. Cos it’s quite simple messages isn’t it...?
participant11,212, Interviewee,Yeah. 
participant11,213,Interviewer ,... really. So you think in a school environment people would take it seriously.
participant11,214, Interviewee,"Yeah, probably. "
participant11,215,Interviewer ,"Yeah, fine. Erm, OK. Cos I’m just trying to have a quick think cos let me have a quick check. So, fine. OK. Alright. Were these the kind of things that you expected or did they tell you that I was gona come or did they spring that on you a bit?"
participant11,216, Interviewee,"Yeah, I just"
participant11,217,Dad ,We did have a conversation about it but it was a while ago now 
participant11,218,Interviewer ,Yeah I’m really sorry.
participant11,219,Dad ,No that’s fine. Cos you got a leaflet but I don’t know how long ago it was. 
participant11,220, Interviewee,Yeah I got a leaflet.
participant11,221,Interviewer ,(unclear - 00:17:41)
participant11,222,Dad ,We did And I think we reminded Elaine because was obviously hoping for the voucher so we just thought...
participant11,223,Interviewer ,Yeah of course.
participant11,224,Dad ,"Had Elaine done it and then she said Oh yeah, yeah we had but then didn’t plot when it was gonna be or anything like that. "
participant11,225,Interviewer ,No that’s alright. Was this the kind of... what you kind of expected the talk to be like? Is this what you expected us to talk about a bit?
participant11,226,Dad ,Yeah.
participant11,227, Interviewee,Ah ha. 
participant11,228,Interviewer ,Yeah.
participant11,229,Dad ,I thought it was specific to Testicular Cancer but that’s fine.
participant11,230,Interviewer ,"And that’s... and I think what you sort of said as well. I think that’s really important because I think there’s loads of information again. I don’t know, would have you ever... How would you look up information if you had some symptoms I don’t know?"
participant11,231, Interviewee,Just on the Internet. 
participant11,232,Interviewer ,Would you use Google do you know?
participant11,233, Interviewee,Yeah.
participant11,234,Interviewer ,And so yeah on Google there’s lot of information from adults about Testicular Cancer but there’s really nothing about torsion which for you it’s about four times more common again.
participant11,235, Interviewee,Hm.
participant11,236,Interviewer ,Not specifically that you’re going to get any of the conditions. It’s just to be aware but yeah. It’s four times as common but yet there’s just not the information really on it. 
participant11,237,Dad ,So how does it occur?
participant11,238,Interviewer ,So testicular torsion it’s basically bad luck. 
participant11,239,Dad ,Ah right.
participant11,240,Interviewer ,"Some men’s testicles sit a bit more, sort of flatter and have a bit less attachments and then something can happen, so, you know, it gets cold and so your cremasteric muscles and your muscles around your testicle and under the spermatic cord and they can "
participant11,241,Dad ,Hm.
participant11,242,Interviewer ,And that can cause a twist or a little bit of an injury can provoke it. And sometimes it’s just totally bad luck and it happens. So about one in ten men has a slightly risky...
participant11,243,Dad ,Hm.
participant11,244,Interviewer ,"... with their anatomy. But only as I say one in eight hundred has the condition and if something else, it happens then it wouldn’t be a problem. It’s just basically bad luck and... "
participant11,245,Dad ,And the people that get it then go and to come to see you within six hours. 
participant11,246,Interviewer ,Hm.
participant11,247,Dad ,Is that a higher proportion than the ones that do then? Is that why it’s prompted the research?
participant11,248,Interviewer ,Yeah exactly. So in children and young people about half the people lose their testicles. 
participant11,249,Dad ,Hm.
participant11,250,Interviewer ,"Whereas in adults it’s about twenty percent. And that’s mostly because for whatever reason, people over eighteen feel much more able to come to hospital or whether they know about it or but whatever reason so. For me as a surgeon, I just hate if someone c"
participant11,251,Dad ,Hm.
participant11,252,Interviewer ,Why do you men not know about this?
participant11,253,Dad ,Hm.
participant11,254,Interviewer ,So I decided to take a bit of time from actually my day job to see if I could find out why and then my hope is to make an education resource that’s appropriate. But I think you’re right. I think the schools is a really good idea. I think all it needs to b
participant11,255,Dad ,Right.
participant11,256, Interviewee,Yeah.
participant11,257,Dad ,So the first stop would be Google as well wouldn’t it?
participant11,258,Interviewer ,Yeah. 
participant11,259,Dad ,Of if there’s not much on-line then.
participant11,260,Interviewer ,Exactly. Exatly right.
participant11,261,Dad ,And trusted sources that’s the issue as well when you do stuff like that. 
participant11,262,Interviewer ,"Totally, Totally right. Yeah. Just quickly, what social media account can you use?"
participant11,263, Interviewee,Erm... Facebook and Snapchat.
participant11,264,Interviewer ,Yeah cos again they don’t have loads of information on them. Facebook might have a bit of information.
participant11,265, Interviewee,"Yeah, I think..."
participant11,266,Interviewer ,It’s not...
participant11,267, Interviewee,Snapchat got this news thing on the side which you can like put stuff on. I don’t really know much about it but it’s kind of like a new news that you can go and read headlines and things like that. 
participant11,268,Interviewer ,Oh really. Perhaps I should start  to get that. I really have no idea. [laughs]. I can have a chat with a Snapchat or something like that.
participant11,269, Interviewee,Yeah. 
participant11,270,Interviewer ,That’s really interesting. That really helpful. Well look I’m really sorry that I’ve run a bit on.
participant11,271,Dad ,That’s OK. 
participant11,272,Interviewer ,Honestly this is exactly... this is exactly what is... It’s perfect. It’s really helping get a picture of what people’s understanding is and the things that might stop them coming in to hospital so my hope is that I want to do something about it. So thank
participant11,273,Dad ,That’s OK.
participant11,274,Interviewer ,So I’m going to stop this. 
participant1215,1,Interviewer ,"Right thank you so much my name is Caroline and I am a doctor and you’re 18 and 16 is that right?   That’s great, so have you spoken to any of the other guys who’ve done the chats with me?"
participant1215,2,Mother ,They’re all younger.
participant1215,3,Interviewer ,"They’re all, I thought yeah fine so and it was just to see ‘cos if you had maybe had a chat with them or something they might have told you a bit about what we’re talking about today but you kind of are a bit unprepared."
participant1215,4,InterviewerntervInterviewerewee ,"Umm, umm."
participant1215,5,Interviewer ,"Yes fine.   So the first thing I always ask you is what do you, what do you call your testicles?  What words would you normally use for testicles?"
participant1215,6, InterviewerntervInterviewerewee 15 ,Balls. [‘Bawz’ Scottish with snigger]
participant1215,7,InterviewerntervInterviewerewee ,"Yeah, yeah pretty good yeah."
participant1215,8,Interviewer ,"And would you use the same word if you were talking to your parents about it?  Would you use the same words do you reckon if you were talking to your maybe a doctor about it?  Would you, or do you think you’d use different words or…"
participant1215,9, InterviewerntervInterviewerewee 12,"Na same word, Bawz [together overtalk]"
participant1215,10,Interviewer ,Yes that’s fine.  Well look I’ll try and remember to use ‘balls’ but sometimes I might say testicles [Families laugh] but you know what I mean.  Yeah cool all right.  Can you remember what lessons have you had or what do you know about testicles?
participant1215,11, InterviewerntervInterviewerewee 12 ,Nothing.  Interviewee 15 Nothing really.
participant1215,12,Interviewer ,Nothing.  Fine so can you remember a time when you’ve ever been told what a testicle does?
participant1215,13, InterviewerntervInterviewerewee 12 ,Aye.
participant1215,14,Interviewer ,"Yeah and where do you, where did you get some information about that?"
participant1215,15, InterviewerntervInterviewerewee 12 ,At school.
participant1215,16,Interviewer ,Fine.
participant1215,17, InterviewerntervInterviewerewee 12 ,In biology I think.
participant1215,18,Interviewer ,Was it?
participant1215,19, InterviewerntervInterviewerewee 12 ,Aye.
participant1215,20,Interviewer ,Fine and do you know how old you were when you were taught about it?
participant1215,21, InterviewerntervInterviewerewee 12 ,Thirteen/fourteen.
participant1215,22,Interviewer ,So yeah so you were like at high school.
participant1215,23, InterviewerntervInterviewerewee 12 ,Aye.
participant1215,24,Interviewer ,And in biology and do you know what you discussed?
participant1215,25, InterviewerntervInterviewerewee 12 ,No I can’t remember.
participant1215,26,Interviewer ,Can’t remember.
participant1215,27, InterviewerntervInterviewerewee 12 ,No.
participant1215,28,Interviewer ,Fine.  Fine so when you’ve had some lessons about testicles do you think it’s been maybe more in biology.
participant1215,29, InterviewerntervInterviewerewee 12 ,"Umm, umm. "
participant1215,30,Interviewer ,And what about your social lessons do you have social lessons?
participant1215,31, InterviewerntervInterviewerewee 12 ,No.  Interviewee 15 Na [agrees]. 
participant1215,32,Mother ,Well you just had sex education.
participant1215,33, InterviewerntervInterviewerewee 12 ,I was P7 ((inaudible - 0 02 05.6)).
participant1215,34,Mother ,"Do you not remember them, no?"
participant1215,35,Interviewer ,What and you obviously know about that so it’s…
participant1215,36,Mother ,He said they had sex education.
participant1215,37,Mother ,Yeah.
participant1215,38,Mother ,And they get taught a lot about things that type of thing.
participant1215,39,Mother ,"When they were younger, there wasnae as much but noo they seem to bring it in a lot because they bring it up and other things as well just part of your body,  to make sure you don’t get touched and things as well."
participant1215,40,Mother ,Yes.
participant1215,41,Mother ,They have really stepped their game up in the past few years.
participant1215,42,Mother ,Yes I think you’re right.
participant1215,43,Mother ,They really have.
participant1215,44,Interviewer ,It’s discussed much more kind of…
participant1215,45,Mother ,"Umm, umm"
participant1215,46,Mother ,And more in depth things…
participant1215,47,Interviewer ,Yeah you’re absolutely right I think that’s right.  
participant1215,48, InterviewerntervInterviewerewee 12 ,Produces sperm.
participant1215,49,Interviewer ,"Yeah you’re absolutely right yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
participant1215,50,InterviewerntervInterviewerewee ,Aye things like that. 
participant1215,51,Interviewer ,"Yeah, yeah, yeah and do you know anything else they do?"
participant1215,52,InterviewerntervInterviewerewee ,No.
participant1215,53,Interviewer ,So do you know that they are like responsible they make your hormones that are like testosterone.
participant1215,54,InterviewerntervInterviewerewee ,Don’t know.
participant1215,55,Interviewer ,So yeah so it’s your testicles that make most of your testosterone which is obviously an important hormone so do you know about testosterone?
participant1215,56,InterviewerntervInterviewerewee ,No.
participant1215,57,Interviewer ,"No so it’s like the hormone that’s kind of, you know I think you’ve both obviously it is ok to say you know you have gone through puberty you have done quite a lot of growing up haven’t you so it’s one of the major hormones that makes that happen and all "
participant1215,58, InterviewerntervInterviewerewee 12 ,Sore.
participant1215,59,Interviewer ,Yeah.
participant1215,60, InterviewerntervInterviewerewee 15 ,You get a hurt in them.
participant1215,61,Interviewer ,Yeah.
participant1215,62,InterviewerntervInterviewerewee ,It is sore or sensitive.
participant1215,63,Interviewer ,"Yes, yes.  You’re certainly right and like when I mean when they’re sore you are absolutely right, you are absolutely right when they are sore what do you like what do you think?  I mean have you had times when your testicles have been sore?"
participant1215,64, InterviewerntervInterviewerewee 12 ,Aye.
participant1215,65,Interviewer ,Yes and have you also had times when your testicles have been sore?
participant1215,66, InterviewerntervInterviewerewee 15 ,From an injury yes.
participant1215,67,Interviewer ,Yes so do they get sore after you’ve had like a groin injury yeah and like other times do you ever have the experiences of testicles being sore apart from that?
participant1215,68, InterviewerntervInterviewerewee 15 ,I have when I wake up in the morning and I’ve been sleeping the wrong way and they’re sore for a bit but it gets better.
participant1215,69,Interviewer ,And they tend to get better.
participant1215,70,InterviewerntervInterviewerewee ,Aye.
participant1215,71,Interviewer ,"Yes, yes and do you know like if your testicles are really sore for a while."
participant1215,72,InterviewerntervInterviewerewee ,"Umm, umm."
participant1215,73,Interviewer ,"So say it was after an hour it didn’t go away do you know, what would you think, what would you do about it?"
participant1215,74,InterviewerntervInterviewerewee ,Tell somebody I was a bit worried.
participant1215,75,Interviewer ,Yes.
participant1215,76,InterviewerntervInterviewerewee ,"Maybe not right away but, I’d worry about it, aye. "
participant1215,77,Interviewer ,"So say you did get sore, sore testicles that are quite bad that kind of goes on and doesn’t go away what would be your first kind of, what would you do, what do you think you’d do about it like practically?"
participant1215,78, InterviewerntervInterviewerewee 15 ,Try and see a doctor.
participant1215,79,Interviewer ,Go to the doctor’s.
participant1215,80,InterviewerntervInterviewerewee ,Aye.
participant1215,81,Interviewer ,And so when you say you go to the doctor’s would you make an appointment with the doctor yourself or…
participant1215,82,InterviewerntervInterviewerewee ,No I’d get my maw to do it.
participant1215,83,Interviewer ,Yeah.  So would your first port of call then do you think be to talk to your Mother.
participant1215,84,InterviewerntervInterviewerewee ,No.
participant1215,85,Interviewer ,No.
participant1215,86, InterviewerntervInterviewerewee 12 ,I’d get her to get a doctor’s appointment and then tell her what I want to talk about.
participant1215,87,Interviewer ,That’s really interesting yeah fine so and would you normally when you go to the doctors would you go with your Mother or…?
participant1215,88,InterviewerntervInterviewerewee ,No I’d [inaudible].
participant1215,89,Interviewer ,"Yeah but she might, that’s cool so you’d probably ask your Mother to make you an appointment you go to the doctors and would your Mother tend to stay in or do you think she’d go out what would you, or would she come with you?   What would you do about tha"
participant1215,90,InterviewerntervInterviewerewee ,It depends what I’m seeing him for.
participant1215,91,Interviewer ,Yes.
participant1215,92,InterviewerntervInterviewerewee ,If I am going for just a cold or something she’d come in.
participant1215,93,Mother ,He’s never been to the doctors by hiself anyway.
participant1215,94,Interviewer ,Yeah.
participant1215,95,Interviewer ,And you’re at this kind of age where…
participant1215,96,Mother ,"Aye probably gonna start to,  to be honest."
participant1215,97,Interviewer ,Yeah.
participant1215,98,Mother ,Do you know that way like …
participant1215,99,Interviewer ,When was the last time you went to the doctors?
participant1215,100,Mother ,A couple of months ago.
participant1215,101,Interviewer ,Fine ok and when you were there your Mother was in or not?
participant1215,102,InterviewerntervInterviewerewee ,Aye you’re always in.
participant1215,103,Interviewer ,But if it was something about testicles do you think you would be more likely to ask your Mother to stay outside?
participant1215,104,InterviewerntervInterviewerewee ,Aye.
participant1215,105,Interviewer ,So do you think it’s easier to talk to a doctor than your Mother about balls?
participant1215,106, InterviewerntervInterviewerewee 12 ,Aye.
participant1215,107,Interviewer ,Yes.
participant1215,108, InterviewerntervInterviewerewee 15 ,Definitely.
participant1215,109,Interviewer ,Would you agree.
participant1215,110,Mother ,It would be easier for them to talk to their pals like they two talk to each other about things like that.  Before they’d come to us. They would go to each other they have a couple of good pals.
participant1215,111,Interviewer ,"That’s really interesting.  Yes, yes right so do you think, do you think that you might talk to each other may be about it do you think you may like call your mates?"
participant1215,112,InterviewerntervInterviewerewee ,I wouldn say…
participant1215,113,InterviewerntervInterviewerewee ,Well I’d probably call my pals and ask them and if it didn’t…I’d get to the doctors
participant1215,114,Interviewer ,"Yes, yes."
participant1215,115,InterviewerntervInterviewerewee ,quite natural to talk to them.
participant1215,116,Interviewer ,"Because have any of your pals ever told you that they’ve had like a testicle sort of, have any of your pals had any experience?"
participant1215,117,InterviewerntervInterviewerewee ,My pal was circumcised.
participant1215,118,Interviewer ,"Ok yeah, yeah.   Yeah, yeah and was that recently or was that when he was little?"
participant1215,119,InterviewerntervInterviewerewee ,About two year ago.
participant1215,120,Interviewer ,Right and did he tell you about it?
participant1215,121,InterviewerntervInterviewerewee ,Aye.
participant1215,122,Interviewer ,What did he say?
participant1215,123,InterviewerntervInterviewerewee ,He said it was sore for about a month
participant1215,124,Mother ,He was pretty sore afterwards yeah.
participant1215,125,InterviewerntervInterviewerewee ,Yeah and did he tell you about why he had it done?
participant1215,126,InterviewerntervInterviewerewee ,"Yeah, yeah his foreskin was stush too much skin"
participant1215,127,Interviewer ,"Yes so it sounds as if you had quite a straightforward chat and when he started to tell you about his circumcision did you think it was like how did you, when he first started to tell you what did you think?"
participant1215,128,InterviewerntervInterviewerewee ,I was like that..It didn’t bother me.
participant1215,129,Interviewer ,Yes that’s cool.  It didn’t make you feel embarrassed or like awkward.
participant1215,130,InterviewerntervInterviewerewee ,No.
participant1215,131,Interviewer ,Obviously he had a problem and he got it sorted and then he told you.  Did he tell you about the operation?
participant1215,132,InterviewerntervInterviewerewee ,He was put to sleep for it..
participant1215,133,Interviewer ,Yes fine so it sounds as if you have quite easy conversations with your mates about these kind of things.
participant1215,134,InterviewerntervInterviewerewee ,Aye.
participant1215,135,Interviewer ,And would you say the same do you think you have quite easy chats with your mates?
participant1215,136,InterviewerntervInterviewerewee ,Aye.
participant1215,137,Interviewer ,And if you had a problem actually your mates might be your first port of call or you might ask your Mother to make an appointment for the doctor.
participant1215,138,Mother ,"I say if they ever get any problems they’ll talk to each other but if they are nae sure they will come and talk to you they are quite open so I’ve always said like be open about something because somebody can help you, they’ll help you. So they know that."
participant1215,139,Interviewer ,"Yeah, yeah."
participant1215,140,Mother ,So they are they know that.
participant1215,141,Interviewer ,And if it’s a really severe pain like so rather than just being kind of a moderate pain if it was really bad pain do you think that would change what you do?
participant1215,142,InterviewerntervInterviewerewee ,I would probably still ask to see the doctor.
participant1215,143,InterviewerntervInterviewerewee ,I would probably still be the same
participant1215,144,Interviewer ,Fine and do you know what like the big worry is of like a painful testicle?
participant1215,145,InterviewerntervInterviewerewee ,Pass.
participant1215,146,Interviewer ,And do you know what the worry about painful testicles is?
participant1215,147,Mother ,No.
participant1215,148,Interviewer ,So have you ever heard of a twisted testicle?
participant1215,149,InterviewerntervInterviewerewee ,No. 
participant1215,150,Interviewer ,No.  Ok.   This is what’s really interesting for me ‘cos I’m a paediatric surgeon what I do and paediatrics obviously extends up to kind of your age group or maybe they are a little bit younger but there’s a thing called a twisted testicle and basically ‘
participant1215,151,InterviewerntervInterviewerewee ,Awww. [squeamish noise]
participant1215,152,Interviewer ,It is and I just think it’s amazing that people don’t get told about this because it’s so simple to get a really sore testicle you just need to contact someone it’s really simple.  That’s all people need to know as a kid if it’s twisted for longer than si
participant1215,153,InterviewerntervInterviewerewee ,They probably think its nothing and leave it and see what happens. 
participant1215,154,Interviewer ,Yes I think that’s absolutely right.
participant1215,155,Mother ,"See in fairness, like when you get two little boys as well in primary 1, they would be something that we would not be aware of either so we would probably turn them and say right leave it and see how it goes."
participant1215,156,Mother ,or you Banged yourself.
participant1215,157,Mother ,Aye.
participant1215,158,Mother  ,That’s not something they ever tell you.
participant1215,159,Mother ,I think every boy should be made more aware of it then they would know like all the facts so after a few hours we would have gone straight up you know what I mean.
participant1215,160,Interviewer ,Exactly right yes.
participant1215,161,Mother ,If he came I would have thought he has been playing out the back. And give him a bit of calpol.
participant1215,162,Mother ,Aye.
participant1215,163,Interviewer ,Exactly right.  Exactly right so it is the kind of thing where it is like significant pain it is like sore but you know I do know that young men often will just sit at home hoping it goes away and then in that time they lose a testicle which is just such 
participant1215,164,InterviewerntervInterviewerewee ,No.
participant1215,165,Interviewer ,I think ‘cos lots of us say oh well kids you know kids are embarrassed or young people are embarrassed to come to hospital and I am not sure that the embarrassment does…
participant1215,166,Mother ,No I wouldn’t say that no because if they’re sick they’ll turn round and say.  If they’re really feeling rubbish then they’ll tell you they need to see a doctor. but if they say it’s real bad I think now that you’ve explained that to them that they should
participant1215,167,Interviewer ,"Absolutely right and that’s kind of what I am hoping over the long, like what I can do is to make better education whatever to teach people about it.   So that’s kind of what I want to do.   What do you think is a good way of telling people or teaching pe"
participant1215,168,InterviewerntervInterviewerewee ,"Things like this, meetings, maybe a bigger group, going round aboot, and telling. And schools and stuff"
participant1215,169,Interviewer ,Yes telling people about it
participant1215,170,InterviewerntervInterviewerewee ,((Inaudible - 0 12 03.0))
participant1215,171,Interviewer ,Yes and do you think school’s a good place to learn about it?
participant1215,172,Mother  ,I would definitely say that.
participant1215,173,InterviewerntervInterviewerewee ,"Aye see us in secondry school, for our first school."
participant1215,174,Interviewer ,Because all you need to be told it once. 
participant1215,175,Mother ,That’s it aye.
participant1215,176,Mother ,Something you won’t forget.
participant1215,177,Interviewer ,It’s not complicated is it?  So it’s not like just a say it happens between nought and it can be older but it’s most common at about fifteen but just to say don’t be worried I don’t necessarily think you’ll definitely get it but just so you know about it 
participant1215,178,InterviewerntervInterviewerewee ,Lumps.
participant1215,179,Interviewer ,Exactly right and what have you been taught about lumps?
participant1215,180,InterviewerntervInterviewerewee ,If you feel a lump it could be cancer.
participant1215,181,Interviewer ,"Yes that’s right and have you got any personal experience in the family of cancer sorry if it’s something you don’t want to talk about.   So what, so have you been taught that or where have you picked that up from do you think?"
participant1215,182, InterviewerntervInterviewerewee 15 ,"I think my Mother, but I don’t know how I know it. "
participant1215,183,Interviewer ,"Yes no, no that’s really I think that’s really interesting.  Had you heard about cancer before?"
participant1215,184, InterviewerntervInterviewerewee 12 ,No.
participant1215,185,Interviewer ,Testicular cancer.
participant1215,186,InterviewerntervInterviewerewee ,Not really.
participant1215,187,Interviewer ,Not really no and what about yourselves have you ever…?
participant1215,188,Mother ,My grandad died of testicular cancer right
participant1215,189,Interviewer ,Gosh.
participant1215,190,Mother ,And he actually had kids and they thought he was just sick.
participant1215,191,Interviewer ,Right.
participant1215,192,Mother ,But it was testicular cancer and he held that back from us for a long time right so we went to all these hospital visits thinking it was something else thinking it was just to do with diabetes and then they had to eventually tell us the truth what caused 
participant1215,193,Interviewer ,Oh gosh.
participant1215,194,Mother ,But it never changed anything they still dinae tell them because they just thought it was the right thing to do at the time and just…
participant1215,195,Interviewer ,And what do you think that was about?   Do you think that was because…
participant1215,196,Mother ,Pride they will tell you it was pride.
participant1215,197,Interviewer ,Pride.
participant1215,198,Mother ,They felt it was a bit embarrassing because he was an older generation man ‘cos he was a bit more embarrassed about it than anything else to think that…
participant1215,199,Interviewer ,And do you think it’s the testicle that is particularly embarrassing?
participant1215,200,Mother ,I think so.
participant1215,201,Interviewer ,Yes.
participant1215,202,Mother ,I think it was the fact that he thought I am a man…
participant1215,203,Mother ,That generation.
participant1215,204,Mother ,"Aye I am a man I am supposed to be but the one who brings the money in and puts the food on the table and all that and I am supposed to be fine and dandy, and looking after all you’s,  that’s the way they are all quite old."
participant1215,205,Interviewer ,I mean a testicle is different from like…
participant1215,206,Mother ,I know.
participant1215,207,Interviewer ,I suppose a lung or a leg or…
participant1215,208,Mother ,"We all know that but at the time I don’t really think they look at it in that respect.  Like the older generation are harder, like that I think the younger generation are a lot better…"
participant1215,209,Mother ,Yes.
participant1215,210,Mother ,You will listen and you can tell them it’s no a big issue.
participant1215,211,Interviewer ,Yes.
participant1215,212,Mother ,But whereas your grandad and all that kind of stuff they’re a bit ohh ohh [stuffy noise] and we’ll go to the pub and all that kind of stuff. 
participant1215,213,Interviewer ,But you guys as well do you think that if you did say for instance have like a problem with your testicles do you think you would be as happy to talk about it or as cool with it as say it was like I don’t know like a lump in the leg or something do you fe
participant1215,214,InterviewerntervInterviewerewee ,"it is something that I wouldnae be bothered talking about my bawz or anything, but I wouldnae be too bothered talking about it, but obviously you be a bit embarrassed talking about it. "
participant1215,215,Mother ,"Do you think you’d be able to  talk to each other, even in private, or is there anybody else but do you think to you’s two do you think you would talk to [NAME] or do you think you would talk to [NAME] or something like that?"
participant1215,216,InterviewerntervInterviewerewee ,With my pals I’d probably think its funny to be honest.  
participant1215,217, InterviewerntervInterviewerewee 12  ,I’d probably tell yous [ indicating Mother]
participant1215,218,Interviewer ,Do you think there’s any part of getting something wrong with your balls that makes you feel like or like oh this isn’t manly I am a bit less manly do you think there’s any of that kind of stuff going on?
participant1215,219,InterviewerntervInterviewerewee ,No.
participant1215,220,Interviewer ,That’s cool that’s really important I think some people have said before that are a bit worried if they get a problem with their testicles that people will think that it’s their fault or that they have been like doing something.  Do you think you would ev
participant1215,221, InterviewerntervInterviewerewee 12 ,No  Interviewee 15  not really.
participant1215,222,Interviewer ,That’s cool that’s good that’s definitely I am really happy and you know if people ask you questions would you about would you ever be worried about kind of like personal questions like say if someone I am not going to ask you about I’m not asking you abo
participant1215,223,InterviewerntervInterviewerewee ,No.
participant1215,224,Interviewer ,If it’s a doctor say?
participant1215,225,InterviewerntervInterviewerewee ,No.
participant1215,226,Interviewer ,You wouldn’t…
participant1215,227,InterviewerntervInterviewerewee ,No
participant1215,228,Interviewer ,"Yeah fine, fine.   So when we were talking a bit before and it was and thank you like for sharing this about your…"
participant1215,229,Mother ,That’s all right.
participant1215,230,Interviewer ,Your grandpa thank you it’s a shame that the older generation men probably did try to hold so much back isn’t it.
participant1215,231,Mother ,Well I think my dad but I think they still do a bit. Hold back a bit.
participant1215,232,Mother ,"Some do, some do."
participant1215,233,Interviewer ,Have you ever been taught about what you men feel for lumps?  
participant1215,234,InterviewerntervInterviewerewee, NO
participant1215,235,Interviewer ,Have you heard about testicular self-exam?
participant1215,236,InterviewerntervInterviewerewee ,No.
participant1215,237,Interviewer ,"No.  Ok so I guess you’ve not heard about it and no one has spoken to you about it.  So the recommendations are they say every month now I mean it’s one way of thinking about it it’s regular but not like, it’s regular enough that you kind of pick up on an"
participant1215,238,InterviewerntervInterviewerewee ,Probably go to the doctor.
participant1215,239,Interviewer ,Yeah exactly right yes.   So to see a doctor if you…
participant1215,240,Mother ,Would you no be wasting anybody’s time it could be nothing but it’s better getting it checked out.
participant1215,241,Interviewer ,"Absolutely, you are absolutely right and it’s I mean the good thing as well is if you do a testicular exam then you know what your testicles feel like.  So then if anything changes then you know that it’s a new lump or a different lump.  So yeah so it’s r"
participant1215,242,InterviewerntervInterviewerewee ,No not really.
participant1215,243,Interviewer ,No so it’s obviously not come onto your radar so I just mentioned that you can do like a video to find out about self-examination.  Would you use like the internet to find out information do you think?
participant1215,244,InterviewerntervInterviewerewee ,"Aye, I usually go on the internet."
participant1215,245,Interviewer ,Yes and what kind of sites do you use?  What would you use?
participant1215,246,InterviewerntervInterviewerewee ,Things like Google.
participant1215,247,Interviewer ,"Yes some information you’re absolutely right yes and that’s it so with testicular self-exam if you were to, there are You Tube ones and they are mostly they’re not going to be problematic if you go to the phrase ‘self-examination’ so but there will be vid"
participant1215,248,InterviewerntervInterviewerewee ,facebook.
participant1215,249,Interviewer ,Yes.
participant1215,250,InterviewerntervInterviewerewee ,On Facebook you may see something.
participant1215,251,Interviewer ,Is there a health campaign on Facebook have you ever seen one?
participant1215,252,InterviewerntervInterviewerewee ,There is an NHS one I don’t know if it was on Facebook it was about condoms and that.
participant1215,253,Interviewer ,Right does that come through on your feed?
participant1215,254,InterviewerntervInterviewerewee ,Aye.
participant1215,255,Interviewer ,And what were you saying sorry I missed that.
participant1215,256,InterviewerntervInterviewerewee ,You could search for things.
participant1215,257,Interviewer ,"Yeah, yeah so if you’re looking for something specific you can search for it and then you’ve noticed that, ‘cos I guess the difference is if you don’t know there’s a problem that you need to know about you don’t know to look for it.  Does that make sense?"
participant1215,258,Mother ,Put in the NHS and go through it through the NHS to find something.
participant1215,259,Interviewer ,Yes.
participant1215,260,Mother ,that will tell you.
participant1215,261,Interviewer ,Absolutely and where would you go for information about health?
participant1215,262,Mother ,If he came to me health-wise personally I would take them to the Sandiford Clinic.
participant1215,263,Interviewer ,Yes.
participant1215,264,Mother ,Because they would be the best person to give them advice because I might not know if it’s the best I would take them to somebody that does.
participant1215,265,Interviewer ,Yes.
participant1215,266,Mother ,So that would be my port of call.
participant1215,267,Interviewer ,"Yes.  Do you think, what do you think young people think about hospitals?  Do you have an impression in your head, have you been to hospital?"
participant1215,268,InterviewerntervInterviewerewee ,Aye.
participant1215,269,Interviewer ,"You’ve been, have you been and what did you think of hospitals?"
participant1215,270,InterviewerntervInterviewerewee ,Lots of doctors
participant1215,271,Mother ,The best right like…
participant1215,272,InterviewerntervInterviewerewee ,Just the place of doctors
participant1215,273,Interviewer ,"But say like you don’t think, do you think anyone would think I don’t want to go into hospital I don’t want to have an operation.  Do you think that would put people off going into hospital?"
participant1215,274,InterviewerntervInterviewerewee ,Probably.  Probably.
participant1215,275,Interviewer ,Do you have conversations about any health issues with your mates?
participant1215,276,InterviewerntervInterviewerewee ,I don’t know.  Probably …
participant1215,277,InterviewerntervInterviewerewee ,"We just don’t think of it that way, we just talk shit anyway."
participant1215,278,Interviewer ,Yes so can you think in the last month of any conversations you’ve had about you know operations or like health with your mates?
participant1215,279,InterviewerntervInterviewerewee ,We had conversations about wains [Glaswegian for children]
participant1215,280,Interviewer ,Yeah.
participant1215,281,InterviewerntervInterviewerewee ,Aye.
participant1215,282,Interviewer ,Oh gosh. Is there something you need to tell your parents
participant1215,283,Interviewer ,But you do like but you having…
participant1215,284,InterviewerntervInterviewerewee ,About when we’re older we want Wains
participant1215,285,Interviewer ,Absolutely that’s really interesting.  Do you think most of your mates like want to have children at the moment?
participant1215,286,InterviewerntervInterviewerewee ,Probably a few don’t want children at the moment
participant1215,287,Interviewer ,Yes.
participant1215,288,Mother ,I think the age that people having kids now is going to get a bit wait a while their kids ‘cos they’ve seen the struggles that we’ve had as younger parents and they don’t want to do the same thing and then you encourage them don’t have them when you’re yo
participant1215,289,Interviewer ,"So what advice, have you given, like what advice have you given [NAME] before have you thought oh well I’ll give him advice about this and this and this in terms of health or anything?"
participant1215,290,Mother ,The other day we were talking about some random stuff you know what I mean it sudden comes up in conversation say something comes on telly we’ll talk about that and I’ll go you know when it comes up a bit more do you know what I mean but if he canna talk 
participant1215,291,Interviewer ,lots of people say it and some people mean it more than others.
participant1215,292,Mother ,I think as long as there is somebody to go and talk to and as long as they know there is it’s not a problem.
participant1215,293,Interviewer ,Yes.  Fantastic.
participant1215,294,Mother ,"It’s quite good because we are quite a close-knit family, we’ve been friends for years"
participant1215,295,Mother ,"And in fairness, I must say one thing, you don’t hear much about testicular cancer it’s always other cancers but never really testicular cancer.  I’d say there’s more for women but…"
participant1215,296,Interviewer ,You mean than there is for…
participant1215,297,Mother ,Than there is for men and it’s wrong do you know what I mean it should be both.
participant1215,298,Interviewer ,"Yes and also yeah there’s you know men and women at your age have equal health but women come to doctors lots and like young men don’t come to hospital they don’t come to doctors.  Does that sound like I mean does that sound like what you think, what feel"
participant1215,299, InterviewerntervInterviewerewee 15 ,"I’ve always in the Doctor’s , man"
participant1215,300, InterviewerntervInterviewerewee 15 ,I’ve always done it.
participant1215,301,Interviewer ,All right well I’ll…
participant1215,302,Mother ,"I don’t remember the last time you went to the doctors , do you?"
participant1215,303, InterviewerntervInterviewerewee 12 ,I don’t know
participant1215,304,Mother ,Last two year ago.
participant1215,305,Interviewer ,There are a couple of people that have been in the news who have had testicular cancer have you heard of Lance Armstrong?
participant1215,306,InterviewerntervInterviewerewee ,Aye.
participant1215,307,Interviewer ,"So he’s I think he had testicular cancer I think and I think there was a footballer but you’re right people don’t, women will talk about whether they have had breast cancer young men maybe don’t know like they talk."
participant1215,308,Mother ,That’s right.
participant1215,309,Mother ,It’s more a regular thing that you here about 
participant1215,310,Interviewer ,"It’s one in ten thousand so it’s, so I don’t know how many are at your school?"
participant1215,311,Mother ,Nine hundred.
participant1215,312,Interviewer ,"So yeah so if you imagine probably one of the schools in Glasgow that’s per year so it maybe one of the schools in Glasgow, if you imagine yours is a thousand so ten schools like yours will have one young man a year will develop testicular cancer."
participant1215,313,Mother ,You were saying something to me this morning weren’t you about a boy in Drum Chapel got cancer.
participant1215,314,InterviewerntervInterviewerewee ,Aye he had [inaudible]
participant1215,315,Mother ,And his pals went and shaved all their hair off so that they could be the same with him.
participant1215,316,Interviewer ,Yeah.
participant1215,317,Mother ,I thought that’s good but he’s in remission.
participant1215,318,Interviewer ,"Good, good."
participant1215,319,Mother ,And I thought well that’s good that you’ve always had that thing but does it come back.  You will you will always have that.  I thought that was good to I mean they know these days they talk about things.
participant1215,320,Interviewer ,Yes.
participant1215,321,Mother ,And people talk about other things to other people and then it goes round do you know what I mean that’s what I’m saying about the six hour thing guaranteed they’ll say to somebody.  Somebody will say to somebody else and word of mouth.
participant1215,322,Interviewer ,"Word of mouth I think is really, really good but it does mean like people like me have to, which means that if you, you know if you’ve spoken to someone like me or you know someone else then that helps but people in communities where no one is doing this "
participant1215,323,Mother ,I wish someone had told me something like that…
participant1215,324,Interviewer ,Yes if you’ve got boys.
participant1215,325,Mother ,Aye I’ve got two boys and she’s got two boys and…
participant1215,326,Interviewer ,"‘Cos it can happen from babies it can happen at any point so it’s but it’s up to, normally it doesn’t happen if you are older so about one in eight hundred a year so your school there will be one person a year who has it so that’s…"
participant1215,327,Mother2 ,And it just happens through nothing.
participant1215,328,Interviewer ,"Yes it can be if you get, you know you said about a knock it can happen and if it’s cold and you know your muscle tenses and it pulls up your testicles sometimes that can do it but it’s basically just bad luck there’s nothing it’s nothing to do with like "
participant1215,329,Mother ,It just shows you.
participant1215,330,Interviewer ,"Yes, yes great right well look let me just see I’ve got some things that I wanted to cover I just want to check that we’ve covered all of these.  Was this what you were expecting when, is it the kind of thing that you were expecting?"
participant1215,331, InterviewerntervInterviewerewee 12 ,No not really.
participant1215,332,Interviewer ,What were you thinking?
participant1215,333, InterviewerntervInterviewerewee 12 ,I don’t know I thought I was to be about cancer and stuff like that so…
participant1215,334,Interviewer ,I think that’s getting lots of information as well for adults because it’s not so much information but I guess you are both kind of coming up to be adults now but what would be really useful for me is that I want to see people all the way from like eleven
participant1215,335,Mother ,"I really think you should speak to the school right, and they would have a wee thing for you and you could done one for them and get parents up that’s school’s really good for that ‘cos some of the things you spoke about it’s opened my eyes, it’s opened y"
participant1215,336,Interviewer ,Well yeah we’ll have a chat about that what contacts do you have there do you?
participant1215,337,Mother ,"The headmistresses is really good he came out, she is she can do for the children about information she really does go ahead with it.  She will actually get you in one afternoon for about half an hour before they finish and things."
participant1215,338,Interviewer ,What do you want me to do?  Do you want me to get in contact with her or do you…
participant1215,339,Mother ,I can speak to her.
participant1215,340,Interviewer;,You can speak to her do you mean ‘cos you’ve got the number now and the email address have a chat with her and I will be really happy to go in.  I mean to be honest I could do like twenty minutes and just chat because there are other conditions of the tes
participant1215,341,Mother ,‘Cos these would need itself it would be worth talking to his school and all. cos the stuff that they wouldn’t know do you know what I mean and its quite useful information so…
participant1215,342,Interviewer ,Yes well look if you give her my details then she can…
participant1215,343,Mother ,It will probably be I would say…
participant1215,344,Interviewer ,Yes after Christmas because there is a lot going on isn’t there.
participant1215,345,Mother ,They’ve got the Christmas show and all that like so …
participant1215,346,Interviewer ,"No quite.  No if it is going to be in next term then might, if you’ve got lots on for the end of term…"
participant1215,347,Mother ,They have got that Christmas Fair and then they’ve got the primary one where they have a bit of a show both are next week so…
participant1215,348,Interviewer ,I like it when it gets busy before Christmas it’s like…
participant1215,349,Mother ,I get back home and….I can’t get my Christmas tree up because I’m decorating.
participant1215,350,Interviewer ,Right ok thank you so much for that and I’ll stop there.
participant13,1,Interviewer,"Right.  I am going to put that there as, so that’s the recording thing."
participant13,2,Interviewee,Does that record what I say?
participant13,3,Interviewer,It’s just so that I can type it up later.
participant13,4,Mother,So she does no forget.
participant13,5,Interviewer,Exactly.
participant13,6,Mother,Like me I forget.
participant13,7,Interviewer,What I will do I will delete all the stuff like so your voice stuff will get deleted after I’ve like typed it up and it will never get taken back to you because I like destroy any link between any of the words and what you’ve said yourself it’s all entire
participant13,8,Interviewee,Your balls something get cancer or something.
participant13,9,Interviewer,Ok all right then so you know the bit about talking about well balls yeah.
participant13,10,Interviewee,Yes.
participant13,11,Interviewer,So what word would you normally use for balls?  Is that the word you’d use or…?
participant13,12,Interviewee,Yes.
participant13,13,Interviewer,"Yeah do, have you heard the word ‘testicles’ before?"
participant13,14,Interviewee,Yes.
participant13,15,Interviewer,Yes fine and if you had to talk about them with anyone what words do you think you’d use?
participant13,16,Interviewee,To my teacher ‘testicles’.
participant13,17,Interviewer,‘Testicles’ yes absolutely right.
participant13,18,Interviewee,And my pals ‘balls’.
participant13,19,Interviewer,Pals ‘balls’.  What about your gran?
participant13,20,Interviewee,I wouldn’t talk to her about that.
participant13,21,Interviewer,And why do you think you wouldn’t talk to her about these things?
participant13,22,Interviewee,Because she’s too old and she doesn’t know what I’m talking about.
participant13,23,Interviewer,But you’re right sorry I am not…
participant13,24,Mother,I’m not no.
participant13,25,Interviewer,Thank you so you but you probably wouldn’t…
participant13,26,Interviewee,Is that a problem?
participant13,27,Interviewer,What’s that yes.  Are you all right with that?
participant13,28,Interviewee,Yeah.
participant13,29,Interviewer,What are you worried about is it the recording?
participant13,30,Interviewee,No.
participant13,31,Interviewer,"No just making sure that I think it’s yes, it’s working.  Yes.   So you probably would feel like you probably wouldn’t talk to your gran about things so much."
participant13,32,Interviewee,No.
participant13,33,Interviewer,And why do you think that is?
participant13,34,Interviewee,I’m always up there.
participant13,35,Interviewer,"You’re always up there is that right, is that right?"
participant13,36,Interviewee,Yeah.
participant13,37,Interviewer,"So if you had, do you have any, if you had any health problems who do you tend to talk to if you have any problems with your health?"
participant13,38,Mother,"So this the difference being no well and having something wrong with down below basically.  Don’t get embarrassed talking about it, if its sore you tell us about it. "
participant13,39,Interviewee,Yeah.
participant13,40,Mother,That what the doctors talking to you about.
participant13,41,Interviewer,Do you think you would be embarrassed or do you think yeah if you did have a problem with your testicles do you …
participant13,42,Mother,I think he would talk back telling you if he was in agony I think.  I think that’s what he would do.
participant13,43,Interviewer,Yes.
participant13,44,Mother,That’s just my opinion right enough. 
participant13,45,Interviewer,Yes what do you think?   Do you agree if you were in a lot of pain…
participant13,46,Mother,It’s just like you to be in the bathroom last things or anything like that or changing his underpants at times.
participant13,47,Interviewer,"Yeah, yeah, yeah.   So you, so obviously you prefer not to see your gran or your gran to see you naked at the moment yes."
participant13,48,Interviewee,Umm [affitmative].
participant13,49,Interviewer,Yes and I mean I think that’s a really common but why do you think that is?
participant13,50,Interviewee,Because it feels wrong.
participant13,51,Interviewer,Ok all right.   So do you know what your testicles do?  Or your balls do.
participant13,52,Interviewee,They make you piss.
participant13,53,Interviewer,Yeah 
participant13,54,Mother,Pee!
participant13,55,Interviewer,"do you, "
participant13,56,Interviewee,Well…
participant13,57,Mother,Go on.
participant13,58,Interviewee,Well…
participant13,59,Mother,What else?
participant13,60,Interviewer,What else?  Do you know what other things do they do?
participant13,61,Interviewee,No.
participant13,62,Interviewer,"Have you had, what school year are you at the moment?"
participant13,63,Interviewee,St Mary’s.
participant13,64,Interviewer,At St Mary’s and you are…
participant13,65,Mother,P 7.
participant13,66,Interviewer,P 7 so you are at the start of P7.
participant13,67,Mother,"Umm, umm."
participant13,68,Interviewer,Have you had any lessons about things like testicles?
participant13,69,Interviewee,No.
participant13,70,Interviewer,"No you haven’t and do you think you, sorry do you know what if you’re going to have, I think you have some lessons about these things in your year."
participant13,71,Mother,I don’t think so no. He’s never mentioned any to me.
participant13,72,Interviewer,Right no that’s fine.   So as far as you’re concerned your balls they help you wee do you know about anything else that they do?
participant13,73,Interviewee,SILENCE.
participant13,74,Interviewer,Is that because you don’t know or because you are a bit shy to talk about that.
participant13,75,Interviewee,I don’t know.
participant13,76,Interviewer,You don’t know.   So at the moment you’re not really sure what they’re for.
participant13,77,Interviewee,No.
participant13,78,Interviewer,No.  Are we okay to talk about that so do you know have you heard before that your testicles make sperm?
participant13,79,Interviewee,Sperm.
participant13,80,Interviewer,Sperm have you heard about sperm?
participant13,81,Interviewee,No.
participant13,82,Interviewer,And have you about hormones like testosterone?
participant13,83,Interviewee,Umm no.
participant13,84,Interviewer,Have you heard of testosterone?
participant13,85,Interviewee,No.
participant13,86,Interviewer,Ok all right then.   So I suspect I think you’re probably going to have some lessons coning up in the school at some point soon but sperms are what helps you if you want to have children in the future and the hormone testosterone is the hormone that helps
participant13,87,Interviewee,You get hairs.
participant13,88,Interviewer,"Exactly all of those exactly all of those kinds of things so yes.   So they are really important these things.  Your sperm so the sperm and the hormones are really important.  Yes but you don’t, you’ve never been told that before."
participant13,89,Interviewee,No.
participant13,90,Interviewer,"No ok.  What is it, so it must be a bit, has it ever intrigued you, have you ever been curious why you have testicles?"
participant13,91,Interviewee,Not particularly.
participant13,92,Interviewer,So then what problems can you get with your testicles?  You were talking a bit about it before.
participant13,93,Interviewee,They can slip out
participant13,94,Interviewer,"Yeah ok just about yeah, yeah so they can fall out.  Have you heard about that or seen that?"
participant13,95,Interviewee,Pictures of it.
participant13,96,Interviewer,You’ve seen pictures of it gosh right and where do you see those pictures?
participant13,97,Interviewee,On Google.
participant13,98,Interviewer,On Google and is that something you’ve been having a look for or like that your mates have shown you or…
participant13,99,Interviewee,I looked it up.
participant13,100,Interviewer,You looked it up and what were you looking up?
participant13,101,Interviewee,Well I was looking for it.
participant13,102,Mother,Was it like….
participant13,103,Interviewer,Why were you looking because you wanted to know so…
participant13,104,Mother,Because yous were coming [indicating the interviewer]
participant13,105,Interviewer,"Fine, fine but you were having a look so what did you, what were you typing in, what were you searching for?"
participant13,106,Interviewee,I just sort of typed in twisted testicles and it just popped up pictures.
participant13,107,Interviewer,Did it what did you think about the pictures?
participant13,108,Mother,They were quite ghastly.
participant13,109,Interviewee,They made me throw up.
participant13,110,Interviewer,"Yeah.  It is it’s quite yeah fine.  So that’s really good then so you had a look at a bit of a look.   What did you, why did you have a look?"
participant13,111,Mother,Last week or the week before.  Not long…
participant13,112,Interviewee,"Twenty-second, twenty-second I think."
participant13,113,Mother,Not long after [participant 8]
participant13,114,Interviewer,"And he told you that yeah.  Fine so you’ve had a little bit of a look at the pictures and so are you, do you feel ok, do you feel a bit upset by that or is it…?"
participant13,115,Interviewee,No.
participant13,116,Interviewer,Just a bit gross.
participant13,117,Interviewee,Yeah.
participant13,118,Interviewer,So what do you know now.   So you’ve had a bit of a look did you get any information from those websites?
participant13,119,Interviewee,I just walked away throwing up.
participant13,120,Interviewer,"Right ok fine, fine it is very reasonable but from looking at those websites it didn’t tell you what you might find, what problems you might have or what to do about it."
participant13,121,Interviewee,No.
participant13,122,Interviewer,"No just had a look ok.   So when you have, so have you ever had pain in your testicles?"
participant13,123,Interviewee,No.
participant13,124,Interviewer,And if you did have pain in your testicles what do you think you would do?
participant13,125,Interviewee,Go to hospital.
participant13,126,Interviewer,That seems very sensible that sounds like the right thing to do yes absolutely because bad pain in the testicles would be the thing that makes you worry about twisted testicles.  Yes and did [NAME] say to you how quickly you need to get to hospital.
participant13,127,Interviewee,No.
participant13,128,Interviewer,"No ok so when you have a twisted testicle it’s about six hours and you need to have an operation otherwise you can lose your testicle.  So it’s quite, quite quick that you need to get to a hospital really."
participant13,129,Mother,And you need get to hospital quite quick.
participant13,130,Interviewer,"Yeah exactly, exactly right.  How do you feel about that?  Do you feel you could get to hospital within six hours?"
participant13,131,Interviewee,"Umm I don’t know, I’d have to ask her."
participant13,132,Interviewer,do you drive?   Do you have a car?
participant13,133,Mother,Aye.
participant13,134,Interviewer,Yes so you would be able to take.
participant13,135,Mother,I would be able to get there in 6 hours that’s fine.
participant13,136,Interviewer,Yeah it was just a matter of like recognising there’s a problem then you’d…
participant13,137,Mother,Aye.
participant13,138,Interviewer,"Yes, yes and had you heard of twisted testicles before I was talking to [NAME] about it?"
participant13,139,Mother,"No, no."
participant13,140,Interviewer,You’d not heard of it before.
participant13,141,Mother,"The only thing that I was telling me the time we went down to the what’s the name of that game, basketball game we went to see what was its name?"
participant13,142,Interviewer,Glasgow rocks
participant13,143,Mother,And they were talking down there and it makes you aware that they need to think of these things but I didn’t think about it.
participant13,144,Interviewer,"Well I think it’s something that’s not that you didn’t think about it, we don’t get told about it really."
participant13,145,Mother,Aye.
participant13,146,Interviewer,"Yes, yes.   So if I was to tell you that you know you need an operation to fix the problem would that be something that would put you off?"
participant13,147,Interviewee,Umm I don’t know.
participant13,148,Interviewer,Have you ever had an operation?
participant13,149,Interviewee,I had my tonsils took out.
participant13,150,Interviewer,Did you do you remember that?
participant13,151,Interviewee,No.
participant13,152,Interviewer,How old were you when it happened?
participant13,153,Mother,Long ago. I think it was like two years now.
participant13,154,Interviewer,Fine do you remember a bit about it?
participant13,155,Mother,It was two years aye.
participant13,156,Interviewer,Do you remember going to sleep?
participant13,157,Interviewee,Yes.
participant13,158,Interviewer,Did you stay in or did you go home the same day?
participant13,159,Interviewee,I stayed.
participant13,160,Interviewer,Did you do you remember staying on the ward?
participant13,161,Mother,Just overnight.
participant13,162,Interviewer,Was that all right?
participant13,163,Interviewee,Umm.
participant13,164,Interviewer,Yes it didn’t bother you?
participant13,165,Interviewee,No
participant13,166,Interviewer,"No, did you have nice doctors?"
participant13,167,Interviewee,Yeah but we were forced to eat stuff.
participant13,168,Interviewer,Did they what the next day or…?
participant13,169,Interviewee,The next day.
participant13,170,Interviewer,They forced you but you weren’t feeling hungry.  No and what about the nurses?
participant13,171,Interviewee,I didn’t get one.
participant13,172,Interviewer,"But it wasn’t too bad, it wasn’t too bad you didn’t mind it too much?  Do you feel better now you’ve had your tonsils out?"
participant13,173,Interviewee,Yeah.
participant13,174,Interviewer,Yeah.
participant13,175,Mother,Yeah he’s a lot better.
participant13,176,Interviewer,Well that’s good then that’s good.
participant13,177,Mother,He’s a lot better.
participant13,178,Interviewer,"Good ok all right.   So you think if you had pain in your testicles you’, what would you do, you’d probably talk to your gran first and then you’d ask to be taken to hospital and then you’d go to hospital and have that, fine.   Do you think you’d tell peo"
participant13,179,Interviewee,No.
participant13,180,Interviewer,No what do you think your mates would say do you think if they knew you’d had a problem with your balls?
participant13,181,Interviewee,"Uewww, I don’t know what they would say."
participant13,182,Interviewer,"Do you reckon, do you think they’d be kind or do you think they’d …"
participant13,183,Mother,"[name] would freak out, haha.  He would think he had it too, wouldnae he. [name] thinks he has it]."
participant13,184,Interviewer,"What do you think do you think your other friends, do you think they would be helpful if you or would they tease you?  Are you not sure?"
participant13,185,Interviewee,No.
participant13,186,Interviewer,"What, do you ever talk about balls with your friends at the moment?"
participant13,187,Interviewee,Umm no.
participant13,188,Interviewer,If one of your mates though talked about balls what do you think you’d think?
participant13,189,Interviewee,Umm don’t know we don’t talk about it.
participant13,190,Interviewer,What about other health things.   Do you talk about other health problems?   Do you ever talk to your mates you know when you had your tonsils done?
participant13,191,Interviewee,"Umm, umm."
participant13,192,Interviewer,What did you say to your mates then?  Did you tell them about it?
participant13,193,Interviewee,No.
participant13,194,Interviewer,No but like you talked to them about it.
participant13,195,Interviewee,I can’t really remember.
participant13,196,Interviewer,You can’t remember I know it’s a couple of years ago and it’s probably difficult.   Do you think you would be shy to talk to your friends?
participant13,197,Interviewee,No
participant13,198,Interviewer,"And do you think, do you think that if it was a testicle operation it would be different to like another operation?"
participant13,199,Interviewee,Yes.
participant13,200,Interviewer,Do you think you would be more shy?
participant13,201,Interviewee,Yes.
participant13,202,Interviewer,Yeah.  Why do you think that is?
participant13,203,Interviewee,Because you have to explain about your thingamys and all that and that would be embarrassing.
participant13,204,Interviewer,And why do you think it’s particularly more embarrassing to talk about your testicles than any other things?
participant13,205,Interviewee,‘Cos it sounds gross and all that.
participant13,206,Interviewer,"Sounds gross, fair enough and do you know about any other problems you can get with your testicles because you were talking about the twist and the injury to your testicles do you know about any other problems?"
participant13,207,Interviewee,You can get black lumps in it.
participant13,208,Interviewer,Yes.
participant13,209,Interviewee,And you can have cancer in it.
participant13,210,Interviewer,Yes you are absolutely right.   Do you know about that again do you know about that from having had a look on the internet or do you think…?
participant13,211,Interviewee,My dad’s told me.
participant13,212,Interviewer,"Is that right and did you have a like, was that like a specific lesson or did he just sit with you or how did it or did it just come up in conversation?"
participant13,213,Interviewee,He just said it ‘cos I said you were coming up. about that.
participant13,214,Interviewer,"Right no that’s really good so maybe talking like with me means that you look like had some conversations about health problems.   So that’s really good and did you, is there anything, how do you, do you know how you know if you have cancer of your testic"
participant13,215,Interviewee,It will hurt.
participant13,216,Interviewer,"It tends not to be sore.  It tends to be like a lump so you might feel a lump in your testicles and do you know, has anyone, I would think and don’t worry because if this is a no has anyone ever talked to you about what you can be doing or what you should"
participant13,217,Interviewee,No.
participant13,218,Interviewer,Have you ever heard of something called ‘self-examination’?
participant13,219,Interviewee,No.
participant13,220,Interviewer,No so we recommend that young men like yourself just examine your testicles about every month.  What that means is just make sure there’s no lumps or bumps.  I think your testicles are probably going to change quite a lot over the next few years so it’s w
participant13,221,Interviewee,No.
participant13,222,Interviewer,Ok all right and if you wanted to find out some information about health problems what would you tend to do?  Where would you go for your information?
participant13,223,Interviewee,Google.
participant13,224,Interviewer,Would you?
participant13,225,Interviewee,Umm.
participant13,226,Interviewer,So what do you search do you have a phone or do you have a tablet what do you use?
participant13,227,Interviewee,My phone.
participant13,228,Interviewer,Your phone you use your phone you Google.  That’s quite a good way of getting lots of information isn’t it?   Do you use anything else like talk to your mates?
participant13,229,Interviewee,No.
participant13,230,Interviewer,Talk to family.
participant13,231,Interviewee,No.
participant13,232,Interviewer,And do you see your doctor very often your family doctor?
participant13,233,Interviewee,No.
participant13,234,Interviewer,"No, most young people dont"
participant13,235,Mother,"I think the last time was about 6 months ago,  just to get his hearing checked so that was that."
participant13,236,Interviewer,Fine ok.
participant13,237,Mother,"Aye he’s not there since his tonsils come out, he’s not had any bother."
participant13,238,Interviewer,Yeah.
participant13,239,Mother,You know what I mean.
participant13,240,Interviewer,"Good, good.  So and what about other, do you have other accounts what other accounts do you have like social media type things?"
participant13,241,Interviewee,You Tube and Instagram and all of that.
participant13,242,Interviewer,Yes.  Do you think you’d ever look on You Tube?
participant13,243,Interviewee,SILENCE
participant13,244,Interviewer,Not really.
participant13,245,Interviewee,I also looked once
participant13,246,Interviewer,Yes.   So you said you Googled stuff as well like that that’s a good way of getting your information isn’t it because it will often take you through to You Tube.
participant13,247,Interviewee,Yeah.
participant13,248,Interviewer,"So I asked this before didn’t I you don’t have, do you talk to your friends about any health problems do you think?  No what about like broken legs?"
participant13,249,Interviewee,No.
participant13,250,Interviewer,Have any of your friends had any operations that you know about?
participant13,251,Interviewee,No.
participant13,252,Interviewer,"No not really.  So generally you are quite a fit and healthy youngsters so it’s not so common for it is it it’s just, I just think it would be interesting to know whether if you don’t have many conversations about testicular health but I guess if people a"
participant13,253,Mother,"I don’t know whether we would talk about that, you know, not until something happens."
participant13,254,Interviewer,"Exactly right, exactly right.  Fine and if you, if there was a way what do you think would be a good way of telling people about testicular health problems?"
participant13,255,Interviewee,I don’t know.
participant13,256,Interviewer,You don’t know.  Are there any things to like that have stood out in your teaching at school or if you has made you really remember stuff?  No.
participant13,257,Interviewee,No.
participant13,258,Interviewer,No what do you think of like leaflets and stuff or posters?
participant13,259,Interviewee,Nothing.
participant13,260,Interviewer,No what about videos?
participant13,261,Interviewee,Umm nothing much.
participant13,262,Interviewer,"Nothing much fine.   So you’re not really sure what would be like the best way of kind of getting information or whatever.  No ok all right, all right.  Let me just grab my list of questions.   Well was this the kind of thing that you were expecting me to"
participant13,263,Interviewee,I didn’t really know what the hell he was talking about.
participant13,264,Interviewer,"Ok all right but do you think do you, do you feel happy, do you understand what kind of we’ve been discussing today?"
participant13,265,Interviewee,yes.
participant13,266,Interviewer,"Yeah so it’s just to say that you don’t need to worry like that death or anything is going to happen to you but it’s just that if you do get a sore testicle as you said absolutely right go to the hospital and we’ll see, we’ll deal with it but it’s not som"
participant13,267,Interviewee,In my class it’s thirty-two.
participant13,268,Interviewer,"Thirty-two and then how many, anyway I don’t know how that, but you know probably you know somebody in your school potentially you know will have had a testicular problem really with their testicles so that’s why it’s just worth knowing about it so if it "
participant13,269,Mother,Just so you know what to do about that.
participant13,270,Interviewer,Yes exactly right yeah.  You don’t need to be really worried at this stage of your life.  Good.  Good right let me just have a quick look at my questions and see.  Right if I said to you though some boys when they get painful testicles don’t go to hospita
participant13,271,Interviewee,They are too shy to tell somebody.
participant13,272,Interviewer,Umm do you think it’s shy to tell their family or shy to tell doctors or who do you think the most kind of difficult person to tell is?
participant13,273,Interviewee,Teachers as well.
participant13,274,Interviewer,Teachers yes.  Yeah you’re right because you don’t I guess it’s more difficult isn’t it with a teacher yeah.  So if you are school and it might be difficult.  Yeah what would you do if it happened if you got a painful testicle in school then do you think?
participant13,275,Interviewee,I’d have to tell them.
participant13,276,Interviewer,"Yeah, yes but you would prefer, prefer to tell someone else if you could.  Ok, ok fine, fine.   Well I think that’s probably it’s quite straightforward I think that’s most of the questions I wanted to ask really.  Was there anything else that you wanted t"
participant13,277,Interviewee,Not particularly.
participant13,278,Interviewer,Well thank you.
participant13,279,Mother,It was more he was worried he was getting examined.
participant13,280,Interviewer,Yes.
participant13,281,Mother,"The ones that had had it, [NAME] and wee [name]"
participant13,282,Interviewer,Yes.
participant13,283,Mother,"And they were saying, ohh you’re going to get examined and it’s sore and all that, you know I mean."
participant13,284,Interviewer,Is that right was he saying that?  He was teasing you I think.
participant13,285,Mother,"Yeah they were just kidding on, so we knew it wasn’t right because the mothers said you just come in and spoke about it and that."
participant13,286,Interviewer,"Yeah, yeah.  Yeah that but…"
participant13,287,Mother,He was thinking he was going to get examined.
participant13,288,Interviewer,Well is that right?  He’s a cheeky boy.
participant13,289,Interviewer,"No that’s nothing like that obviously that’s really, that’s really all I wanted to talk about.  It’s really helpful to me because the more I build-up a picture of what people know about and what they feel about it the more it helps me I hope make educatio"
participant13,290,Mother,They know about it earlier.
participant13,291,Interviewer,"Exactly right, exactly right but yeah is that ok?  Is that ok with both of you?"
participant13,292,Mother,Aye that’s fine aye.
participant13,293,Interviewer,Well look thank you for your time I really appreciate it.
participant14,1,Interviewer,"Thank you so much for agreeing to help me with the project.  Have you spoken to any of the other guys about, have any of your friends done this?"
participant14,2,Interviewee,Yeah a little bit.
participant14,3,Interviewer,"Yes fine, fine.   So tell me so you’ve had a bit of a chat since they’ve done their interview?"
participant14,4,Interviewee,Yeah.
participant14,5,Interviewer,Yeah and did they talk to you a bit about the kind of things we’ve been discussing?
participant14,6,Interviewee,Yeah just said it was fine.
participant14,7,Interviewer,It was fine did they?
participant14,8,Interviewee,Yeah.
participant14,9,Interviewer,So when they said it was fine is that because there was a bit of worry that it might be a not very nice thing or that there was some difficulty about the interview?
participant14,10,Interviewee,Yes.
participant14,11,Interviewer,Yes and what do you think those worries were about the interview that I was doing?
participant14,12,Interviewee,I’m not sure.
participant14,13,Interviewer,"And it’s also totally fine to not feel quite sure about it.  Was it, first of all some people have said that they were a bit worried about an examination or something practical like that.  Was that something people have been talking about?"
participant14,14,Interviewee,Yeah a little bit.
participant14,15,Interviewer,Ok right.  So there’s nothing like that.
participant14,16,Interviewee,No.
participant14,17,Interviewer,Fine and do you think that there was worries that I might be asking questions that were a bit kind of difficult or personal or sensitive?
participant14,18,Interviewee,Yeah.
participant14,19,Interviewer,Yes ok and I don’t think I will be asking you anything like that.   So did they talk a bit about the actual interview and what we talked about?
participant14,20,Interviewee,Not that much no.
participant14,21,Interviewer,But a little bit.
participant14,22,Interviewee,Yep.
participant14,23,Interviewer,"So what have they, what did they mention or did they say about that?"
participant14,24,Interviewee,They just said that it’s it didn’t take long and that is was like…
participant14,25,Interviewer,"Ok, ok and did they talk about like the specifics and what the actual things that we talked about?"
participant14,26,Interviewee,Not really no.
participant14,27,Interviewer,"Ok, ok that’s cool.  It’s just so I can get a bit of an idea whether you’ve had a bit of a chat about stuff or you already kind of know a bit about it.   So the first thing I tend to ask people is what words do you tend to use for testicles?"
participant14,28,Interviewee,Phew – ahhhh… balls probably.
participant14,29,Interviewer,Yes that’s a pretty good one.
participant14,30,Mother,I think that’s a pretty common one.
participant14,31,Interviewer,"Yes yeah, yeah and is that the word you would use with your mum, with your friends like who would do you think you’d use ‘balls’ with?"
participant14,32,Interviewee,Yeah friends.
participant14,33,Interviewer,Friends more.
participant14,34,Interviewee,Yeah.
participant14,35,Interviewer,"Umm, umm and if you were speaking to your mum or your dad or parent do you think you’d use the same?"
participant14,36,Interviewee,Yeah probably.
participant14,37,Interviewer,Yes fine.
participant14,38,Mother,Does his dad not say cha-cha’s.
participant14,39,Interviewer,"Oh that’s a new one I like that, I like that I’m not sure I’ve heard that one before I really like it cha-chas fine and have you ever needed to talk to anyone about any problems with testicles and stuff."
participant14,40,Interviewee,No.
participant14,41,Interviewer,"No ok.   So today I don’t know what, have you got any preference about what words we use?"
participant14,42,Interviewee,No.
participant14,43,Interviewer,But yeah because it’s a bit more formal I tend to use ‘testicles’.
participant14,44,Interviewee,Yes.
participant14,45,Interviewer,But I just if you did want to use a different word.
participant14,46,Interviewee,That’s ok.
participant14,47,Interviewer,So do you know what testicles are for?
participant14,48,Interviewee,Erm not really.  I’ve learnt it but I’ve forgotten.
participant14,49,Interviewer,Ok all right and where do you think you learnt about it?
participant14,50,Interviewee,Well last year.
participant14,51,Interviewer,"Fine so that was when your, so what year are you now?"
participant14,52,Interviewee,S3.
participant14,53,Interviewer,S3 so in S2 you do a bit of education.
participant14,54,Interviewee,Yeah.
participant14,55,Interviewer,Do you know what the education was about?
participant14,56,Interviewee,Well we were just doing the body.
participant14,57,Interviewer,Oh right and would you have said that was in biology or in science or was that in your sort of social lessons and things?
participant14,58,Interviewee,Both I think.
participant14,59,Interviewer,"Ok all right.  All right, all right.   So you do remember that you had some lessons about testicles."
participant14,60,Interviewee,Umm.
participant14,61,Interviewer,And that it was about maybe the body.
participant14,62,Interviewee,Yep.
participant14,63,Interviewer,"And maybe, could you, I mean did you have to do things like label stuff or was it…"
participant14,64,Interviewee,Yep.
participant14,65,Interviewer,And did it talk a bit about the functions do you think or…?
participant14,66,Interviewee,Yes I think so yes.
participant14,67,Interviewer,And you know you said you’re not absolutely sure is that something you’d maybe feel a bit embarrassed to say what they do or was it just you are not absolutely sure?
participant14,68,Interviewee,I have forgotten.
participant14,69,Interviewer,I think that’s very possible isn’t it.   So if I say the two main functions for the testicles.  They make sperm.
participant14,70,Interviewee,Yeah.
participant14,71,Interviewer,And then they also really importantly make hormones.
participant14,72,Interviewee,Yeah.
participant14,73,Interviewer,"Do you think, have you heard, you’ve heard that kind of stuff before?"
participant14,74,Interviewee,Yeah.
participant14,75,Interviewer,Yes and does that sound like how you were taught about it or…?
participant14,76,Interviewee,Yeah.
participant14,77,Interviewer,Yes so you talked about it quite as in like science and talking about the body and function and things like that.
participant14,78,Interviewee,Yes.
participant14,79,Interviewer,"Fine and was it at all associated with your, like your sex lessons or your sex education?"
participant14,80,Interviewee,Yeah.
participant14,81,Mother,I think it was wasn’t it and reproduction.
participant14,82,Interviewer,So those are the two things combined did they or was it all very much about kind of the science and the biology of it or did they talk about the other aspects of kind of…
participant14,83,Interviewee,More the science.
participant14,84,Interviewer,Ok so it’s quite sort of practical and that kind of thing.
participant14,85,Interviewee,Umm.
participant14,86,Interviewer,Fine.  Did they talk about like testicles and puberty and stuff like that or…?
participant14,87,Interviewee,No not really.
participant14,88,Mother,Did you not find out what they do to your body?   In PHSE.  I am sure you did but I might be wrong.
participant14,89,Interviewer,"It’s very variable, it’s also very variable.  Sometimes there’s not it’s not necessarily defined programmes so…"
participant14,90,Mother,"Ah ha, ah ha. "
participant14,91,Interviewer,Because I think often people have their first lessons maybe P7 and then they learn a bit more a bit later.
participant14,92,Mother,"Ah ha, ah ha."
participant14,93,Interviewer,"But so the things that I said about the hormones first, puberty and manliness and that kind of stuff and the sperm you heard those kind of things."
participant14,94,Interviewee,Yes.
participant14,95,Interviewer,"That before, fine, fine.  Do you know about any problems you can have with your testicles?"
participant14,96,Interviewee,Well I knew about the testicular cancer but not much else
participant14,97,Interviewer,"Umm yes, yes."
participant14,98,Interviewee,But not much else.
participant14,99,Interviewer,Yes fine so tell me a bit about and I am sorry is there’s anything personal but tell me a bit about what you know about testicular cancer.
participant14,100,Interviewee,Not much.
participant14,101,Interviewer,Not much.
participant14,102,Interviewee,No.
participant14,103,Mother,That you can get it.
participant14,104,Interviewee,Yes.
participant14,105,Interviewer,"So how do you know about it?  You don’t think you’ve had any, have you had teaching on it or how do you think you know about testicular cancer?"
participant14,106,Interviewee,"Not teaching but err I don’t know I just,…. I can’t remember I don’t know.  I don’t know how I really know about it I just do."
participant14,107,Interviewer,"I think this is really, this is what a bit about what I want to find out about is how people do get their information about stuff.   So I think it’s really interesting that you are a bit aware about testicular cancer but you’re not quite sure where it’s c"
participant14,108,Interviewee,No.
participant14,109,Interviewer,No so you kind of know that it’s there and do you know who gets testicular cancer?  Do you know what age you might get it?
participant14,110,Interviewee,Not really no.
participant14,111,Interviewer,Not really and do you know of anyone who’s had testicular cancer?
participant14,112,Interviewee,No.
participant14,113,Interviewer,"No ok all right.   So, so the first thing that ‘cos we’re going to talk about…"
participant14,114,Mother,"You know but you might not remember that you may have heard in passing, know [NAME]."
participant14,115,Interviewee,[NAME]?
participant14,116,Mother,[NAME].
participant14,117,Interviewee,Oh yeah.
participant14,118,Mother,Yes he had testicular cancer.
participant14,119,Interviewee,Aye.  I didn’t know that.
participant14,120,Mother,Did you not?
participant14,121,Interviewee,No.
participant14,122,Mother,"That’s a friend of ours, that’s a family friend."
participant14,123,Interviewer,Did you know that he’d been unwell at all or did you just not really….
participant14,124,Mother,We don’t see him that much. He’s fine now
participant14,125,Interviewer,How long ago did he have it?
participant14,126,Mother,Maybe about three years ago.
participant14,127,Interviewer,Ok all right.
participant14,128,Mother,Three or four years ago something like that.
participant14,129,Interviewer,You wouldn’t have been old enough to kind of know about that.
participant14,130,Mother,Yeah he maybe just heard in passing or maybe you were just not hearing it at all about it.  You may not have heard us talk about it but…
participant14,131,Interviewer,Yes.  So has anyone ever explained to you or talked to you about what’s called a self-examination?
participant14,132,Interviewee,No not really.
participant14,133,Interviewer,"No, not really.   So does that mean that you might have heard something or just…?"
participant14,134,Interviewee,I’ve not.  Well I know self and I know examination.
participant14,135,Interviewer,Yeah you can work it out yes.   That’s really sensible yeah absolutely right I mean it’s not rocket science you are absolutely right it’s really straightforward but the recommendations would be for young men to probably just do what’s called a self-examin
participant14,136,Interviewee,Tell my mum probably.
participant14,137,Interviewer,"Yeah, yeah that seems like a very sensible thing and in that scenario what do you think you’d do?"
participant14,138,Mother,Oh I think we’d need to get it checked out just to be sure yes.  We’d go down and make a doctor’s appointment and ask the doctor just to check just to be sure that it was nothing.   That’s what we would do.
participant14,139,Interviewer,Yes you’d probably make an appointment with your family doctor.
participant14,140,Mother,Yes.
participant14,141,Interviewer,"Ok that sounds very sensible.  So there are, there is a bit of information if you want to look at it on self-examination online but it is very straightforward it’s very simple yes.  Have you heard about any other problems you can get with your testicles?"
participant14,142,Interviewee,No.
participant14,143,Interviewer,No ok.  Do you know what would happen if you had pain in your testicles?
participant14,144,Interviewee,What I would do?
participant14,145,Interviewer,Yeah if you had sort of pain in your testicles and it’s reasonably bad let’s say it’s a pretty bad pain what do you think you’d do about it?
participant14,146,Interviewee,Maybe like wait a bit until it could pass and if it doesn’t just tell my mum again.
participant14,147,Interviewer,"Yes absolutely.   So is that, have you ever had any experience of pain?"
participant14,148,Interviewee,Not really no.
participant14,149,Interviewer,Not really.
participant14,150,Mother,Did you not get a football or a hockey ball went near was that not quite recently?
participant14,151,Interviewee,Yeah.
participant14,152,Mother,Was that one?
participant14,153,Interviewer,But after you had a knock it got better how quickly did it get better?
participant14,154,Interviewee,Pretty quickly it was five to ten minutes.
participant14,155,Interviewer,Yeah.
participant14,156,Interviewee,Something like that.
participant14,157,Interviewer,"Fine, fine and what would be the reason?  Why do you think you would wait to see it sounds like to see if it goes away on itself is that right?"
participant14,158,Interviewee,Yeah.
participant14,159,Interviewer,Yes and why do you think you’d wait?
participant14,160,Interviewee,"I don’t know if, if it didn’t go away….  I don’t know."
participant14,161,Interviewer,"I think what you said is absolutely right because I am not questioning about that I think you are absolutely right I think a lot of young men would wait so I totally agree I am just trying to work out a bit why if you did have like, if you did have like n"
participant14,162,Interviewee,"If it went away and if it went away quickly it might not think there was a serious but if it didn’t go away then you would think it would, there’s a problem."
participant14,163,Interviewer,Yes so you are almost like hopeful that it’s…
participant14,164,Interviewee,Yeah.
participant14,165,Interviewer,Yeah hopeful kind of that it’s not something serious.   Do you think any part of that worry would be about or it would be embarrassing if they say something and it turns out to be nothing or…?
participant14,166,Interviewee,Yeah.
participant14,167,Interviewer,How do you feel about you know if you are unwell how do you feel about telling someone like generally?
participant14,168,Interviewee,I feel ok.
participant14,169,Interviewer,It’s not like you feel oh I have to just get on I have to be strong and tough.  So if you are unwell you feel that’s ok to talk about it?
participant14,170,Interviewee,Yes.
participant14,171,Interviewer,And do you think testicles are different from kind of general health or do you think they’re kind of it’s a similar thing?
participant14,172,Interviewee,Yeah a wee bit different ‘cos like pain in your testicles doesn’t happen as much as being your stomach or something.
participant14,173,Interviewer,"Yeah, yeah, yes so you sort of know a bit more you’ve got a bit more experience what to do.   So if you’ve got pain in your stomach you kind of often know that it will probably get better and if it doesn’t then maybe yeah but pain in the testicles is a bi"
participant14,174,Interviewee,Umm.
participant14,175,Interviewer,Yes.  How long do you think you would leave it?
participant14,176,Interviewee,Not that long.  Like a couple of hours or something.
participant14,177,Interviewer,"Ok yes, yeah, yeah.  What do you think, what if he came to you with pain in his testicles what do you think you would do?"
participant14,178,Mother,What would I do?
participant14,179,Interviewer,Yeah.
participant14,180,Mother,"If he came to, well I think, as I said before, I think I would make a GPs appointment."
participant14,181,Interviewer,"And a GP appointment can sometimes take, it sometimes can take a couple of days to come through.  What yeah what do you think your sort of thoughts would be about the urgency of it?"
participant14,182,Mother,Well to be honest I would probably be straight on Mr Google and read up.
participant14,183,Interviewer,"Yeah, yeah."
participant14,184,Mother,"And try and do a wee bit of self-diagnosis and find out how sore is it, where is it, have you checked for any lumps and sort of any indication of that actually waiting is not a good idea then I think that’s what I would probably do.  Try and get some info"
participant14,185,Interviewer,"I think that’s really and have you got experience of using Google in that way?   Have you, or…"
participant14,186,Mother,Yes.
participant14,187,Interviewer,And do you have websites that you kind of like or that you use are there any particular sites?
participant14,188,Mother,I mean I ‘ve used you know the NHS Direct like you know website before and then and just really actually Boots do quite a good one.
participant14,189,Interviewer,"Yes Boots MD,  it is a good one you have to pay for some of the others, if there’s advertising isn’t it, it’s quite a good one yes."
participant14,190,Mother,And then just read up and you know then just do a general Google one and once I think I’m confident of what I am looking for I would do just a general search thing to read up on you know.
participant14,191,Interviewer,"Yeah do you think you’d look for the information ever yourself?  You know say, so say you’ve got a painful testicle and it’s been going on a couple of hours and do you think your first port of call generally for health stuff would be talking to your paren"
participant14,192,Interviewee,Nah just probably just talk to my friends.
participant14,193,Interviewer,"Yes, yes.  Have you ever needed to have talks with your parents about other health things you know I was thinking about like headaches or I don’t know things like this?"
participant14,194,Interviewee,Well yeah I suppose yeah.
participant14,195,Mother,You tell me things.
participant14,196,Interviewee,Yeah I tell mum most things.
participant14,197,Interviewer,Yeah so most of the stuff you do if you have anything symptoms or such things you’d talk to your mum.
participant14,198,Interviewee,Yes.
participant14,199,Interviewer,And do you ever talk to your mates about health things?  
participant14,200,Interviewee,Not really.
participant14,201,Interviewer,No.
participant14,202,Interviewee,Not that much.
participant14,203,Interviewer,No do you know any of your friends who have had to have operations for anything?
participant14,204,Interviewee,Yep my friend had his appendix taken out.
participant14,205,Interviewer,Right yes.
participant14,206,Interviewee,Yeah I think that’s it.
participant14,207,Interviewer,So did he say if that was a bad experience what it was like?
participant14,208,Interviewee,Not really.
participant14,209,Interviewer,No.
participant14,210,Mother,Typical boys.
participant14,211,Interviewer,"Yeah certainly yeah, yeah that’s fine."
participant14,212,Mother,"I had my appendix out, end of conversation. "
participant14,213,Interviewer,Yes so that’s interesting.   So there’s this thing that can happen to testicles that it’s called testicular torsion or twisting.  I don’t know if you’ve heard about this ever.
participant14,214,Interviewee,No.
participant14,215,Interviewer,Never heard about it.
participant14,216,Interviewee,No.
participant14,217,Interviewer,Have you ever heard about it?
participant14,218,Mother,I yes but I don’t know much about it though.
participant14,219,Interviewer,"So it’s really, so I am a surgeon by trade and unfortunately when young men get testicular torsion they get pain in their testicles and the problem I have is that it’s only about six hours in which I need to do an operation.  So if a testicle twists itsel"
participant14,220,Interviewee,Yeah.
participant14,221,Interviewer,"It’s just something that’s never been taught to you and it seems a shame doesn’t it that it’s such a simple thing to know about but could save your testicles which is quite a big deal really.   So what do you think, do you, do you, what do you think would"
participant14,222,Interviewee,It’s not knowing about it.
participant14,223,Interviewer,I think you’re right.  Yes I think you’re right.
participant14,224,Mother,It’s amazing.
participant14,225,Interviewer,Absolutely.  Do you think there’s an element of embarrassment or not wanting to talk to a doctor?
participant14,226,Interviewee,Yeah maybe a little bit.
participant14,227,Interviewer,But more than that I mean from what I’ve said to you now would there be anything that if you got testicular pain tomorrow is there anything that would make you hesitate about going to hospital or…?
participant14,228,Interviewee,No probably not.
participant14,229,Interviewer,Another thing is that sometimes by the time you’ve seen your GP and by the time they’ve referred you across it’s another two or three hours down the line so what we normally ask is if you do have you know this pain in the testicles to come straight to the
participant14,230,Mother,"Is this a sharp excruciating pain that you would respond to I don’t know that people would be aware of, ‘cos sometimes it can get like a dull ache and pain and you go oh it’s not right but I don’t feel too bad or it’s ok and that’s the time where I mean I"
participant14,231,Interviewer,"Yes so that’s really, a really important question there.   I think the pain from testicular torsion is significant and it’s ongoing and it’s kind of constant and it is, it is bad.  I think I mean it’s difficult describing pain is a very funny thing isn’t "
participant14,232,Mother,Yes ah ha.
participant14,233,Interviewer,It’s a hard thing to describe but yes no it is ongoing and it’s generally pretty bad and it’s something that you know about but just like that people still don’t often like still don’t come to us at all so obviously not bad enough to make every person thi
participant14,234,Mother,Yeah.
participant14,235,Interviewer,Have you ever been in an emergency like a health emergency or anything like that?
participant14,236,Interviewee,Yeah I’ve broken my finger.
participant14,237,Interviewer,Did you right yes.
participant14,238,Mother,Hes had a few sports injuries.
participant14,239,Interviewer,"Well exactly yes so tell me about, so tell me what so what, how, what he had to have done then if you had…?"
participant14,240,Interviewee,This pinky this part of my hand and yeah I think that’s it.
participant14,241,Interviewer,And did you end up having to have an operation?
participant14,242,Interviewee,No.
participant14,243,Interviewer,"No but did they cast you have you been, had a cast or what…"
participant14,244,Interviewee,Yes.
participant14,245,Interviewer,Yeah fine.  So how did you know that you needed to go to hospital for your broken bone?
participant14,246,Interviewee,"Well it was, it just fell it was a pretty bad fall so I knew that I’d done something and just my pinky was just…"
participant14,247,Interviewer,Was it facing the wrong way?
participant14,248,Interviewee,"No but it was just really, really sore."
participant14,249,Interviewer,So it was really sore and straightaway it was pretty sore.
participant14,250,Interviewee,Yeah.
participant14,251,Interviewer,And you were abroad then as well of course were you in …?
participant14,252,Mother,It was just up in Bearsden.
participant14,253,Interviewer,"Oh yeah fine so that’s good so I guess if you knew the hospital so did you go to the hospital or did you, what did you do or…?"
participant14,254,Interviewee,Yes.
participant14,255,Interviewer,Yeah fine.  Fine.  So you’ve had experience of that and then the other time you had your injury?
participant14,256,Interviewee,That was years ago when we were living in Australia
participant14,257,Mother,That’s a really bad example.
participant14,258,Interviewee,Yeah.
participant14,259,Mother,Because you didn’t go to the hospital.
participant14,260,Interviewee,Because…
participant14,261,Interviewer,Well no absolutely yes so you didn’t…
participant14,262,Interviewee,So it was just it was football actually I’ve broken it a few times.  The other one but the one in the I just realised I’d done something badly in it I stubbed my finger but I didn’t go to the hospital for months and …
participant14,263,Mother,No it wasn’t months.
participant14,264,Interviewee,Well weeks.
participant14,265,Mother,"It was a week to ten days we thought oh it doesn’t look as if it’s quite right and we took him and he had a hair line fracture.  But you went it, it was more the way you said it, it was almost as if you sort of bent you know staved it and a whole week I m"
participant14,266,Interviewer,"Yes, yeah, yeah."
participant14,267,Mother,But it was broken.
participant14,268,Interviewer,But you eventually you were like no it isn’t getting better it isn’t getting right and then…
participant14,269,Interviewee,Yeah.
participant14,270,Interviewer,And then as a family you kind of decided right yeah you need to go. yeah.  So it’s interesting how as a family you make a decision about the point at which it is bad enough to need to go to hospital.   So I guess you have your opinion and you chat with yo
participant14,271,Mother,I mean we’ve had a few…
participant14,272,Interviewee,Yeah but it’s normally just catching a football as well.
participant14,273,Mother,Yeah but also there were a few A&E cases where it was bundled straight in the car and off to A&E without a blink of an eye. You fell off the wooden sofa and your arms were inside your tee shirt so he bumped his face on the concrete floor and it was just i
participant14,274,Interviewer,"Yes, yeah, yeah."
participant14,275,Mother,"And flying your kite.  You’ve had a few touch wood, probably in the last maybe in the last few years but when you were small there were quite a few"
participant14,276,Interviewer,"So you’ve obviously had injuries and in a way I would you just described to me you’re very much normal kind of you know upbringing like you do stuff together but do you, there’s something like testicular pain it’s different to injuries do you think or do "
participant14,277,Interviewee,Yeah ‘cos it’s not as common.
participant14,278,Interviewer,"Yes so do you think some of it is about how common it is and how you know you’ve got, you’ve had your injuries and you’ve probably got mates who’ve had injuries and you’ve probably got mates who’ve had operations for broken bones as such but you’ve never "
participant14,279,Interviewee,No.
participant14,280,Interviewer,So it’s difficult to know how you would respond in that situation if you’ve never kind of thought about it.   Ok all right.  That’s really interesting yes.   So if I wanted to tell people about his problem so that you got to hospital quicker what do you t
participant14,281,Interviewee,School just learning at school.
participant14,282,Interviewer,"Yes.  Do you think you just need to learn that, do you think you need to learn about it once or do you think you need to hear about it a couple of times or…?"
participant14,283,Interviewee,Yes reminders.
participant14,284,Interviewer,Yeah I think well I don’t know what do you think?   Have you got any thoughts about where they could…?
participant14,285,Mother,"Well I guess I think if their mum that there seems much focus on boys’ health and in particular in the recent press.  Health it might be deemed as embarrassing or I think with girls there seems to be more awareness, more promotion, more focus actually on "
participant14,286,Interviewer,You think that’s absolutely true that’s borne out we have lots of things that show that but boys and girls have the same amount of health needs but girls are much more promoted to come to hospital and…
participant14,287,Mother,"And actually that very naturally translates into men’s health which of course is probably you know I know now, you see more than before such as prostrate awareness and testicular cancer and men’s health issues but actually that’s only recently, these sort"
participant14,288,Interviewer,Yes and I must admit having done this project if you look online a lot the information is for adults not for people of your age group so you’re risk of getting a torsion and when I say this I don’t mean to worry you or make you think like this is going to
participant14,289,Mother,Well what causes it – anything?
participant14,290,Interviewer,Bad luck it’s a slight predisposition and then something might happen or sometimes it’s just bad luck and it just happens but please don’t be worried that it’s like anything is like definitely going to happen to you but it’s just that if anything does hap
participant14,291,Interviewee,No we’ve not done that before.
participant14,292,Interviewer,You’ve not done that so all your lessons you’ve had altogether.
participant14,293,Interviewee,Yes.
participant14,294,Mother,They don’t separate girls and boys I think it’s just…
participant14,295,Interviewer,"That’s good.  Fantastic.  Right ok let me just look through my list of questions, I’ve got a list of questions that I was hoping to ask you about but I think that’s a lot of the stuff that I really wanted to ask you about really and get a bit of a feel ab"
participant14,296,Interviewee,Yes.
participant14,297,Interviewer,Yes good and has this helped?
participant14,298,Mother,"Yeah, yeah."
participant14,299,Interviewer,"Good, good, good, good.  Right ok all right then well look, ok well look I really appreciate your time thank you so much.  I’ll stop this now."
